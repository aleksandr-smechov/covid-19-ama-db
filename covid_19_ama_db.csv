"Is there any chance that the 18 month timeline for development of a vaccine can be shortened, and by how much?","This is a great question. There are over 6 different efforts going on to make a vaccine. Some use a new approach called RNA which is unproven. We will have to build lots of manufacturing for the different approaches knowing that some of them will not work. We will need literally billions of vaccines to protect the world. Vaccines require testing to make sure they are safe and effective. Some vaccines like the flu don't for the elderly.

The first vaccines we get will go to health care workers and critical workers. This could happen before 18 months if everything goes well but we and Fauci and others are being careful not to promise this when we are not sure. The work is going at full speed.",thisisbillgates,2020-03-18 13:20:41+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fksnbf/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/,"I’m Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

"Hi Mr. Gates,

In your opinion, after this pandemic comes to a close, however long that may be, what should be the first step we as a global community take so that we are better prepared for the next pandemic?","The [TED talk](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/We-Are-Not-Ready-for-the-Next-Epidemic) I did in 2015 talked about this. We need to have the ability to scale up diagnostics, drugs and vaccines very rapidly. The technologies exist to do this well if the right investments are made. Countries can work together on this.

What about the current crisis worries you the most? What gives you the most hope?,"The current phase has a lot of the cases in rich countries. With the right actions including the testing and social distancing (which I call ""shut down"") within 2-3 months the rich countries should have avoided high levels of infection.

What do you think of the current approach the Netherlands is currently taking to combat this virus? They are not going to a full lockdown but rather try to spread it controllably in order to work towards ‘herd immunity’.,"The only model that is known to work is a serious social distancing effort (""shut down""). If you don't do this then the disease will spread to a high percentage of the population and your hospitals will be overloaded with cases. So this should be avoided despite the problems caused by the ""shut down"".  If a country doesn't control its cases then other countries will prevent anyone going into or coming out of that country. I think the Netherlands will end up doing what other countries are doing.",thisisbillgates,2020-03-18 13:17:45+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fksnbf/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/,"I’m Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

"Bill, I read the [Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) report as well as [this explanation in a historical context.](https://twitter.com/jeremycyoung/status/1239975682643357696) 

Essentially, it says that by doing nothing, 4 million Americans die. Through the mitigation strategy - i.e. social distancing and ""flattening the curve"" - it says that 1.1-2 million Americans will die. However, it also says that the suppression strategy, or ""shutting everything down for 18 months"" - will lead to only a few thousand people dying. 

Do you agree with these numbers, and if so, is there any excuse for not immediately issuing a shelter in place order for the entire country?","Fortunately it appears the parameters used in that model were too negative. The experience in China is the most critical data we have. They did their ""shut down"" and were able to reduce the number of cases. They are testing widely so they see rebounds immediately and so far there have not been a lot. They avoided widespread infection. The Imperial model does not match this experience. Models are only as good as the assumptions put into them. People are working on models that match what we are seeing more closely and they will become a key tool.

"Covid-19 testing standards seem grossly unfair in favor of the rich and famous. Testing is happening for people like professional sports players, even those without any symptoms at all. I’m not talking about health care workers or people in essential jobs- I’m talking about actors, actresses, sports players and so on. On the flip side, the guidance from Kaiser in WA is that you must have a fever of 101.5 and either serious shortness of breath or a bad cough, and even then testing results take 5 days or more.

How is it that even with something like covid-19 testing, which the government is supposed to manage, the rich and famous are getting special treatment? Is there a big stash of tests that are reserved for “people that matter”? Isn’t it hypocritical for everyone else to be told they need to look out for the common good and avoid demanding too much of the health care system, meanwhile the rich and famous get whatever they want, when they want it?","We need to democratize and scale the testing system by having a CDC website that people go to and enter their situation. Priority situations should get tested within 24 hours. This is very possible since many countries have done it. Health care workers for example should have priority. Elderly people should have priority. We will be able to catch up on the testing demand within a few weeks of getting the system in place.

"Do you think there's any chance of the US doing a staggered approach (with respect to social distancing measures and school closings) to keep the load at health care facilities manageable? I saw this idea presented in the recent paper from Imperial College and I'm curious what your thoughts are.

>Given suppression policies may need to be maintained for many months, we examined the impact of an adaptive policy in which social distancing (plus school and university closure, if used) is only initiated after weekly confirmed case incidence in ICU patients (a group of patients highly likely to be tested) exceeds a certain “on” threshold, and is relaxed when ICU case incidence falls below a certain “off” threshold (Figure 4).

"Hello doctor good evening.

1.) Currently (here in the Philippines) we do not have enough test kits, so only those with severe symptoms get tested. Do you know of any flow chart or algorithm that could help those in triage in deciding which patients to send home, to quarantine or get tested? 

2.) We have trouble setting up the flow of patients in the ER. How do we direct traffic? Do we setup a triage post outside the hospital building and direct everyone with cough and fever to a separate clinic?

3.) What machine do you use in the drive through testing? Because it is very hard to set-up a molecular lab outside the hospital. Do you use those that detect antibodies? Or do you use CepheID?

4.) In your experience, does HCQ produce better outcome? What is your opinion regarding Remdesivir?

5.) Will Korea be publishing any treatment guidelines anytime soon? Thank you.

&#x200B;

These are the only questions I can think of as of now. I am sure a lot will come to mind soon. Hope you can answer these.","1. Since we are seeing the spread coming mainly from people showing symptoms, I think it is reasonable to focus on testing these people. It is crucial for the medical team to observe whether high-risk patients (aged 60+, chronic diseases, diabetes, and immune-reducing diseases) develop into severe cases, so they can be prioritized for hospital placement. Low-risk groups are more likely to be sent home and be asked to self-quarantine.

2. In Korea, screening clinics are installed outside the exit of the emergency room to prevent suspected or confirmed patients from entering the emergency room. It is advisable to treat patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in a clinic separately.

3. At the drive-throughs, we secure only the samples and send them to the examination room to conduct a PCR test. Korea uses an independently-developed diagnostic kit instead of a CephelID. 

4. Both drugs are still difficult to assess. Further clinical research should be carried out.

"I’m an RN on an Oncology unit in Florida, there is an ever increasing amount of R/O’s everyday. Our hospital has already restricted N95’s and is now rationing surgical masks unless the patient is actually being tested.

I am worried about my health (CVID), that of my son who has respiratory issues and of all the immunocompromised pt i care for on a daily basis especially if I don’t know I have it.

Am I crazy and thinking it’s completely unsafe to be caring for COVID-19 pt’s without N95 if they are actively coughing and symptomatic even if they are not vented or receiving nebulizers? I feel unsafe and worried about the coming weeks as the 60 beds assigned for COVID likely will not hold them.","I think it’s really important we wear full PPE, which includes gowns, gloves, face masks, and eye shields. The virus has been shown to aerosolize and also be able to spread via our eyelashes. What we recommend healthcare workers do is to have an observer - someone to watch them take on and take off this PPE, since many things often get missed and it’s easy to contaminate yourself if you’re not careful. For example, I may touch my face accidentally while pulling off my mask. It’s like when you’re scuba diving: have a buddy and have a checklist so you don’t drown. 

The truth is we’re all rationing right now. Part of the reason that we’re doing this AMA is that we want people to understand that while, yes masks work, healthcare workers absolutely NEED them right now. We see our colleagues across the country getting ill every day - who will take care of the sick patients when all of the healthcare workers are all ill themselves? So /u/Drgrundle we totally agree that we need as many facemasks and N95's possible. To be clear, even at MGH, we are trying to ration and clean and reuse as much as possible, because we are all at a critically short supply as well. It is a frustrating situation. 

That's why we're asking all non-healthcare workers, please self quarantine. That is the best protection.  The CDC is recommending bandanas, scarves, and other homemade masks if you are able to make them. Try to consider the population as a whole and help us healthcare workers by leaving the disposable N95 masks on the shelves. You really don’t want us wearing homemade ones at work and then taking them from room to room. However, homemade masks (made from teacloth or regular cloth) may still confer a significant degree of protection, and you are likely fine to wear one to the grocery store. These masks likely won’t suffer from the limited supply issue we’re having with manufactured facemasks. We are asking the public to help in this way.

**TL;DR Please wear N95 if you can. Otherwise, save, reuse, and frankly we're just all hoping for the best right now**

"Thanks for doing this, Docs! My question is about the [Imperial College report](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf), specifically the chances of Covid-19 returning in cycles (falling when strict social distancing measures are in place and rising when they are lifted for a period of up to 18 months) until a vaccine is developed. I'm wondering how likely this is. Is this sort of cyclical infection something all epidemiologists consider likely or is it just a guess at the moment? Is it common knowledge among epidemiologists that pandemics of this magnitude will tend to re-appear as the report suggests?","/u/H_Fantods We think this is a pretty good model of the likely scenarios we're facing as a society here. To be clear, the report was for the UK, but if you take these models and plug them into the USA, it does a pretty good job outlining this.[ Credit Twitter Jeremy Young for a really nice breakdown](https://twitter.com/jeremycyoung/status/1239975682643357696) (and if you want to have some nightmares)

""You may or may not have seen the Imperial College of London report. This will and should scare everyone. Let’s walk through what they did: The Imperial College team plugged infection and death rates from China/Korea/Italy into epidemic modelling software and ran a simulation: what happens if the US does absolutely nothing -- if we treat COVID-19 like the flu, go about our business, and let the virus take its course?""

**Now specifically addressing a vaccine and trying to paint our own picture:**

We’ve heard a lot of people say we just need to hold out until a vaccine. Then life will go back to what it was like before, and we have pretty significant concern that it is being treated as a magic bullet to reverse time to what it was like before. But let's paint an alternative picture here where the vaccine is more like the Flu vaccine. The vaccine sort of-maybe works, but we’ll still have an outbreak of the flu every year, and every year thousands of people will die (as they have for many years with the seasonal flu). 

Why do we think that? Well, this novel coronavirus is somewhat related and in the same family as the viruses that cause the common cold (which is usually caused by one of a number of relatively benign coronaviruses). And you can’t really make a vaccine for the common cold. Why? Because by the time we come out with a vaccine to the virus, there may be multiple strains across the world with different genetic variations (imagine COVID with 18 months to evolve). I’m not convinced a new strain won’t just travel to an area immunized for a different strain and resprout again, and that's assuming a vaccine is 100% effective for a particular strain (which it likely won't be).  Now, there are vaccines being developed that target parts of the flu virus that are similar across strains, and that may work with coronaviruses as well, but we’re many years from that point.  

So here’s what I think the future will look like. We’ll get this novel coronavirus under control, if, and only if, we do things like self-quarantine aggressively. We’ll develop a vaccine, and the symptoms will be milder, but it won’t entirely prevent it (much like the flu shot, which decreases the symptoms and duration of - but doesn’t entirely prevent - influenza). But every so often, maybe once or twice a year, there will be flare-ups, and we likely haven’t seen the last of things like occasional city-wide lockdowns and travel restrictions. This might be a new reality for us for a long time. This is assuming we actually do quarantine and self-isolate. If not, well, [read up on the numbers people are projecting](https://twitter.com/jeremycyoung/status/1239975682643357696). I want to try to avoid being too pessimistic here today. It's not fun for a Friday afternoon.


**TL;DR We have choices. Either we self-quarantine and lockdown for a short period (months), or lots of bad things will happen.**

This is the report by the ICL

"Whats the level of concern people should have in supermarkets? More and more in the US people are only leaving their homes to go food shopping only, but there in lies the risk of contracting this virus. My question is, while we should be acutely aware of people sneezing etc around us, what is the RISK of walking through clouds of this virus still being suspended in the air in indoor settings such as a supermarket.","So let’s talk generally about cleaning surfaces, and we’ll also touch on food. 
 
There is some evidence that shows that the virus can be found on surfaces for up to 7 days on a surface if you put droplets of the virus on it. If you cough (aerosolized it) well up to a few hours to days too. A recent study in NEJM showed it can last in the air up to an hour after a sneeze or cough. That is dangerous.
 
In a normal world, I do try to clean contact surfaces every week or two (doorknobs, buttons, etc). In this situation what I recommend is to increase it periodically (perhaps to every 4-6 hours) based on the number of customers and if anyone has symptoms. A person simply handling a doorknob is not an issue, as much as someone coughing and sneezing onto their hand and then handling the doorknob.  This is exceptionally tough for grocery and other stores to gauge, however, and so the important thing is that everyone who is symptomatic (coughing, etc.) absolutely stays home in self-quarantine - you WILL spread the virus if you go out, so please get someone else to bring your groceries to you instead.
 
As we may all be realizing now, in reality, life itself - in every aspect - presents risk factors, but we should use common sense. The most important thing I want to communicate is that people should still continue to live their lives as much as possible with social isolation, continue their normal habits while quarantined, and take care of themselves. This is particular for things like not obsessing with over-cleaning, (which can be harmful). 

However, please be cautious and make sensible decisions about cleanliness when going shopping - for example,* absolutely do wash* your vegetables and food after coming home from the supermarket, where it may have been handled by any number of people before you. Send people to get groceries or have them delivered by people who aren’t coughing or showing symptoms. That would be sensible too. We’ll address wearing masks in public in a different question, but they’re certainly closely related.
 
**TL;DR: Wash your food, hands and surfaces frequently. Stay at home if you have a cough.**

"My five-year-old had her butt kicked by the flu back in mid-December. She was hospitalized for double pneumonia for a few days, and it seemed to take her over a month to fully recover from it all.

How likely would it be that she could have a similar experience with COVID if she catches it?

**Basically, are people that recently suffered from pneumonia more likely to develop the more severe symptoms?**","We are learning a ton about the disease as it progresses. We’re also learning and developing predictive tools to help us figure out how to take care of our patients. For example, a very popular tool called [MDCalc by Graham Walker](https://www.mdcalc.com/covid-19#calcs) just came out based on the science to help us make decisions based on data of when to admit the patients and when to send them home. This will continue to evolve in the next week. The difference in what we could state in our AMA this week just from last is already exponentially better and I anticipate it will continue trending in that direction. Specifically for prior pneumonia? We're not sure. However, we do have enough information to make some guesses and paint a picture of what this disease looks like for most people:

**If you’re on the mild trajectory.**
* Day 1: The first symptom is usually a fever. You might have fatigue, muscle aches, and a dry cough. 
* Day 5: You might get worse shortness of breath at this point, especially if you have other medical problems. 
* Day 17: The symptoms continue, but get milder and milder until you get fully better. The trajectory is a lot like a flu, and how bad it is depends on your baseline health.

**If you’re on the critically ill trajectory**

* Day 1: The first symptom is usually a fever still. You might have fatigue, muscle aches, and a dry cough. Some patients are particularly susceptible with diarrhea and abdominal pain. We think this cohort does worse than the rest (diarrhea).
* Day 5: Your symptoms continue and it feels like a flu. You might get worse shortness of breath at this point, especially if you have other medical problems. 
* Day 7: At this point in other countries, people are admitted to the hospital. You have Dyspnea, which is shortness of breath while speaking. This is usually the symptom that we make that has patients admitted to the hospital
* Day 8: ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome, where a significant amount of fluid builds up in the lungs from leaky capillaries, builds up. This is while you are in the ICU and on a ventilator. At this point you worsen to death or you improve in the ICU. This is the critical time for improvement or worsening.
* 17 days later: On average, the people who make a full recovery from the virus after discharge from the hospital do so after 2.5 weeks. 

So far we don’t know if the things we’ve seen in Italy and China will apply here in the USA. We’re still around day 14 for the first smaller clusters, especially in Boston. It might feel like an eternity ago, but in Boston the first cluster linked to the Biogen cluster was March 8th, almost 2 weeks ago. 

To give all a sense of how rapidly this is changing, on 3/19 the first cohort of data came out of Washington State that looked at these patients. We are still digesting this and rapidly learning new things.

What are you seeing in the ERs as far as this is hitting people in their 20s and 30s? There seems to be conflicting information coming in on that from other countries.  Thank you for your amazing work and dedication to all of us.,"I just admitted a patient to the hospital yesterday who was not old enough to drink alcohol legally in the US. This patient had gone on spring break and come back with a cough and shortness of breath so bad he could barely walk across a room. I am very concerned that younger people look at the mortality numbers from the WHO (0.2%) and not realize they are susceptible too. Sure, they may only die at 0.2%, but they are susceptible to hospitalization, ICU admission. 

14-20% of patients 20-44 needed hospitalization from a CDC report that recently came out. Sure we may be able to keep these people alive 0.2% of the time, but is that really the best way to measure risk? I want to emphasize this because it’s important for young people to do their part with social distancing.

I am also very concerned about what will happen because of spring break. I think there have been reports of younger people ignoring social distancing recommendations and then potentially returning home from vacations and spreading COVID.

Just last Saturday, a digital health thermometer company, Kinsa, showed data that indicated an unusual rise in fevers in South Florida, even though it's not a known Covid-19 cluster. Our worry: is this because of spring breakers? The elderly? A local cluster in Florida? The fear is that this will be a potential new spreading cluster with people flying back from spring break into their homes and igniting thousands of smaller cluster across the USA. Keep in mind that the South Korean outbreak can almost solely be attributed to a single person (Patinet #31) who did not self quarantine, then went to church and buffets while positive with COVID. Please, please let's do our part to not be that patient.

**TL;DR: Please don’t be our patient #31. Self isolate, especially if you’re young and healthy.**

"ELI5, when studies now show that the virus can live in the air, what exactly does that mean? Clouds when people sneeze that just hang there? When they breathe? Could you sneeze and then have it float across a certain distance before it dissipates?","Unfortunately, the fact that it is airborne means that yes, it looks like it just stays in the air like a cloud. We think this means that it probably stays infectious too. Remember, these are slightly separate things, but at this point we have to assume it does. The study we’re referencing is the NEJM one below. 

“COVID remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours), with a reduction in infectious titer from 103.5 to 102.7 TCID50 per liter of air.”

What the researchers did was to create an experiment where they simulated sneezing/coughing, and then looked at how the amount of virus decreases while in the air. Remember, clouds of virus don’t just appear and disappear, they slowly dissipate. You can measure that with half life: how long it takes for the initial amount to cut in half. So it's not totally clear how long it is staying around, but it is clear that it can probably be transmitted just by floating in the air. And it probably remains infectious. Ooph. We learned this lesson from the SARS epidemic and we think its probably the same here too.

I definitely would like to know when to go to the ER. I’m a little nervous I can’t get healthcare.,"**Two things:**

**First,** I think its important for people to remember that we’re treating patients here in the Emergency Department for COVID, but we’re also here for all your other emergency medical needs as well /u/ashley_oc . We still see patients with strokes, heart attacks, gunshot wounds, car accidents, blood clots, and all the things that people regularly have, which are quite deadly in themselves. My biggest fear during all this is that someone with shortness of breath will test negative for coronavirus but then be found days later to have a severe pulmonary embolism that was passed over because we were only focusing on COVID. Its important for people who need care to come to the ER, that’s why we’re here. We’re the front door of the hospital - that’s our mission.  The reason that we became emergency physicians was so we could offer that care 24/7/365. We hope to make sure that the message gets out that we’re still here for people, even (especially!) for non-COVID related concerns.

**Second:** the dividing line for when we have told people to come to the ER has and continues to be based on symptoms: If you are having a hard time breathing or feel awful, call you doctor or, if you can’t get a hold of them, come to the ER. We’ve had patients with home oxygen monitors who have noticed that their numbers drop into the 80s (normal is above 95%) when they walk around at home and feel short of breath.  That is something we’d normally only see when you’re ill or at a very high altitude like climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro. While most people probably don’t need a home O2 monitor, we should all listen to our bodies, because our symptoms can often correlate with vital signs (like our blood pressure or oxygen saturation). If you feel short of breath while doing your day to day activities, I think that's the time to come in.

**TL;DR: Come in when you feel short of breath. It could be a reason to admit you for COVID, or it could be something else that’s dangerous. We don’t know until we see you.**",Emergencydocs,2020-03-20 13:26:16+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/flvu7k/im_ali_raja_md_and_shuhan_he_md_emergency/,"I'm Ali Raja, MD and Shuhan He, MD emergency physicians from Mass General Hospital/Harvard Medical School.

"Should I wear a mask? I don't have any symptoms as of now. I'm getting different inputs from different sources so I'm a bit confused.. If yes, which mask should I use?","This is something I think is really important to address. Do you remember #flattenthecurve? One of the things that happens in crisis is that valuable supplies, or sometimes even things that have no trouble going around, predictably become scarce because of hoarding/overuse. That means people buy all that they can get their hands on and then it just sits on a shelf somewhere. This goes for hospital ICU beds, toilet paper (are you really using all that toilet paper?), and also for personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks. One of the things we are seeing was that hospitals themselves can’t purchase any PPE because so many people, both government, hospitals, and regular folks are buying masks.

This is because masks work. Of course they do. There is ample evidence that the virus is transmitted by airborne droplets (NEJM report below) and that masks of all types do prevent infections. 

However the mask situation is like the toilet paper situation. When everyone tries to buy toilet paper at once, there is no toilet paper left. That is a peak in the curve. But when everyone buys TP at a slow regular pace, there is usually enough to go around. That is a peak that can hopefully be flattened.

Now imagine that same situation for those of us in healthcare. If everyone buys masks at the same time, then the masks are like your TP—nothing left. This means the nurses taking care of coronavirus patients don’t have masks, which means they will get sick. What happens if there are no doctors, nurses, PAs, NPs, environmental services personnel, or other staff left to take care of the sick, and we are all ill? Essentially, there won’t be any of us available to treat you when you do.  Thus the need to leave masks for healthcare workers. [We talked about it over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/flvu7k/im_ali_raja_md_and_shuhan_he_md_emergency/fl1bm3y/): 

**TL;DR: Wear a mask, but a homemade one if you can. Please save us the reusable N95's, or we might have a shortage of doctors & nurses if/when you get it.**

Thanks so much for doing this AMA. Please feel free to answer any one or more of these questions that you can, or think are legitimate:

1) Doesn’t flattening the curve rely on the premise that people who are infected and recover become immune and can’t get reinfected? Which as I understand it is something that’s not clear yet? 

2)If people can get reinfected after recovering doesn’t it make it that much harder to successfully flatten the curve and to build herd immunity? 

3) Why are people talking in weeks or 6 months, what can realistically change in that time? Isn’t he only real solution a vaccine and/or effective targeted antivirals that will take a minimum of 18 months to develop? 

4) And even then, can’t the virus mutate and wipe out the process made in finding vaccines or treatments? Do you think in the future this will become endemic in the population like the flu but more deadly?","1. Yes, to some degree. Usually infection and recovery presumes immunity. This is generally what we are seeing out of Asia.

2. yes, but we think this is likely an outlier scenario and much less likely.

3. I am not exactly sure the reference to weeks/months, but I think this is in reference to quarantine. In reality true vaccines will take months. 

4. Yes we do think there is some possibility this happens.[ See our answer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/flvu7k/im_ali_raja_md_and_shuhan_he_md_emergency/fl1dega/)",Emergencydocs,2020-03-20 14:55:38+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/flvu7k/im_ali_raja_md_and_shuhan_he_md_emergency/,"I'm Ali Raja, MD and Shuhan He, MD emergency physicians from Mass General Hospital/Harvard Medical School.

"Is there anything we can do to help fight this, other than staying home as much as possible? Any way to support the health care workers from home?","This is Shuhan. I want to discuss this point specifically. In the past week alone I have been reached out to something like 500 times by people with really unique talents, skills and abilities to help. I absolutely am floored with the care and dedication people have. I posted this below in a Facebook group and I think it bears worth repeating here: We have a lot of needs, and here is how I think people can be most helpful:

1) Focus on consumers. Can you provide PPE that decreases demand from the private sector to maximize supply among the medical community? We are in critically short supply and our husbands/wives/loved ones are starting to make us masks. Before I would have wondered if it really is kosher for me to wear a homemade mask between patient to patient. Now I know that might be a reality. But I beg people to try to save the N95's for us. Of the patients I saw in the ER the other night, something like 60% had COVID. We see many of them and are at very high risk. Increased production of other types of masks would be incredibly helpful for this effort. 

2) Education among the population: can you find ways to decrease barriers to understanding and maximize responsible actions like social distancing, hand hygiene, and self-quarantine? This AMA by itself is incredibly helpful. Please keep spreading the message.

3) Issues with self-quarantine: Can you assist with technology that can make self-quarantine more tolerable, humane, easy for those most vulnerable in the population? (homeless, etc). The truth is the most vulnerable in our society will not be able to self-quarantine, perpetuating infections.

4) Childcare: Schools are closed and many healthcare providers have families. If healthcare providers cannot care for their children, they cannot go to work. This is a major issue being discussed in healthcare right now. Something that we discussed in our recent AMA:

""I do want to mention that closing schools has a HUGE impact on us and everyone in healthcare. Both my wife and I work in healthcare... if our schools close, how do we both continue to see patients when one of us has to stay home with the kids? Sure, we can afford sitters, but demand is high and - more importantly - many of our coworkers (from nurses to the very important environmental staff that disinfect rooms of infected patients) often cannot. The decision to close schools can have far-reaching impact beyond the kids who are students at them.""

Are you guys testing Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine already? What's your opinion on those?,"Let’s talk about this drug and study, as it has certainly garnered a significant amount of interest in the last 48 hours. First and foremost, yes we are testing these drugs combinations of these drugs in our hospital. Almost every hospital is doing some sort of research to find out how we can better take care of those in need. For confidentiality sake, we can’t say exactly what is happening, but we are working very hard on counting the numbers, and learning about if there is real data on if these drugs work. 

Right now, there is definitely enough data to think that it might work and to study it more. We want to caveat that it is important to keep these results in context. 

Here is the study that is of interest:
https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hydroxychloroquine_final_DOI_IJAA.pdf

**We want to emphasize again the importance of caution here.** 

These drugs still need more data. This one study by itself is littered problems. Let’s walk through this:

1. First of all, the trial is really small and might not be more broadly applicable. 

2. Second, alot of patients in the treatment group dropped out. This is a really odd signal. Imagine a scenario where you have a drug that actually does harm, causing them to drop from the study. The people left over will consequently look quite healthy. So we might actually just be seeing data about how fast it makes people be removed from a study after being harmed than to be cured.

3. Third, usually, you want the groups who get treated and not treated to be the same so you can really look at the effect of the drug. In this study, we can’t do that. The treated group looks much healthier at the start than the untreated group.

So short to say, we don’t know, but its certainly enough hope and signal to try and look as fast as we can more deeply.

However, even assuming it works, the worst scenario is a run much like toilet paper on Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, so much that we can’t study it or prescribe it to those most in need. Hospitals themselves may run short on supply if we find that we cannot obtain the drug itself and speculation runs rampant.

We both expect this to start some larger trials. These drugs have a long history of safety and efficacy in humans and they’re both relatively inexpensive generic drugs. We are working really hard to find out if this is true.",Emergencydocs,2020-03-20 14:51:11+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/flvu7k/im_ali_raja_md_and_shuhan_he_md_emergency/,"I'm Ali Raja, MD and Shuhan He, MD emergency physicians from Mass General Hospital/Harvard Medical School.

"I and others in my family have a mild cold/cough.

How do I know if it's COVID-19? Is there any recommended treatment or procedure besides self-quarantine?

If we do have one of the milder/asymptomatic cases, is there a point at which we have enough immunity that we can step into places of known infection to help ease the burden there, or safely bridge a gap between infected and uninfected?

Are the odds likely that it's just a cold? The way it has come up, it's not like allergies.","All the data so far is suggesting that a runny or congested nose, or watery eyes are less likely to be part of COVID-19. 
 
Its a really quick and easy way to tell that you probably don’t have it, especially since we’re facing so many testing shortages. Obviously the best way to tell is more testing, and its something everyone in the medical field is advocating for. But in the interim, those two symptoms (nose and eye symptoms) are a good way to distinguish between the two.
 
Here is what I am doing when I am seeing patients
 
Question 1: Are you sneezing, or have runny eyes? If yes, then its less likely. In fact these two symptoms are not part of our hospital wide algorithm to test as it stands.
 
Question 2: Do you feel short of breath? If you do, then you should see a doctor immediately. This is your sign to go to the hospital, just like any other time when you have any other disease. If you can’t catch your breath, or speak without feeling short of breath, or just generally feel crummy, please come in, we want to see you and treat you.
 
Now the caveat to all the discussion above, is that in life, no rule goes unbroken, and there are still some people with COVID that will have sneezing, literally the exact opposite of what we just said. That is why the only way to truly know is more testing, and we are hoping that the capability to test more will come soon. That as doctors we have a responsibility to push for.

What is the main reason I should decide it's time to go to the hospital with this?,"
I think the best guidance to ask yourself is: if this were any other disease, would I go to the hospitals with the symptoms I am having? If I have what feels like a Flu, I may have muscle aches and feel crummy, but if I’m still able to eat and drink and get some rest, I should stay home.  If, instead, I get really short of breath and can’t keep any food down, I’d definitely head in.  The same is true with suspected COVID. We don’t have the tools to treat the virus, as clinical trials are still underway. But we do have the tools to treat your body and its symptoms when you’re ill and getting dehydrated. 

There is still no objective clear definition, but to me it's if you are having a hard time breathing or feel awful. We are happy to see you and assess you in real-time, but keep in mind that the danger of this virus is that it causes Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome.

**The most common symptoms are:** 

* fever (87.9%)
* dry cough (67.7%)
* fatigue (38.1%) - these are definitely “mild”

**The next most common were:**

* sputum production (33.4%)
*  shortness of breath (18.6%)
* sore throat (13.9%)
* headache (13.6%), 
* myalgia or arthralgia (14.8%) aka muscle aches or joint pains
*  chills (11.4%)
* nausea or vomiting (5.0%) - you might see these with the flu as well

**Things that seem to be quite rare:** 

* nasal congestion (4.8%)
* diarrhea (3.7%) 
* hemoptysis (coughing up blood) (0.9%)
* conjunctival congestion (0.8%) 

**Things we classified as very severe disease (about 13.8% have this)**

* dyspnea (shortness of breath while speaking)
* Breathing more than 30 breaths a minute
* blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, 
* Some lab data: PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours)

**6.1% are critical** (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure)


**TLDR Mild really does mean mild, and runny nose/ runny eyes probably means you dont have COVID.

"If you are diagnosed with COVID-19 and make a successful recovery, can you get the virus again?","With many viral illnesses, a successful recovery means that most people won’t be reinfected, as the body has built up an immunity to the virus.  We sometimes see reinfection in patients who are ill or immunocompromised, but even that is rare.  With the flu, it actually has multiple strains so when there is “reinfection” it’s often a second infection with a different strain.  So, based on what we know so far, it should be very hard to be reinfected with COVID-19.  However, it’s important to emphasize that we really haven’t seen enough data to rule this out since not enough patients have fully recovered and then been re-exposed, and we’re all extrapolating at this point.

"Hi Dr. Raja and Dr. He! So I live in Boston, I had a question about COVID-19 treatment. In some countries such as Italy, Netherlands, Iran, South Korea, and China -- among others -- we're hearing news that doctors use chloroquine and Remdesivir against COVID-19 patients. Recently, in a press release, China [claimed here](http://news.southcn.com/nfplus/gdjktt/content/2020-03/09/content_190536632.htm) that Chloroquine Phosphate healed patients on average 4.4 days (reddit discussion and translation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ffztou/expert_chloroquine_phosphate_has_a_negative_time/)). However, we're hearing that US doctors will not be able to use these medicines since they're not FDA approved. Is it true that if I show up to Mass General Hospital with complications from COVID-19 doctors would be reluctant to use these medicines even though there is some (although not peer reviewed) evidence that they work in other countries. What will the process of using new drugs in the US look like. Is the roadmap in the order of weeks, or months or years i.e. if it's proved unequivocally that these are helpful drugs in treatment, how long will it take them to be approved in US so that doctors can give them to COVID-19 patients?","/u/BrokenWineGlass in the ER we aren't doing any experimental testing, but I can't comment about what's happening in the ICU as those are other doctors and other departments. As you can imagine trial drugs usually only get tested on the sickest of the sick--our first pledge as doctors was to do no harm. If you look healthy to me and otherwise well, I'd be really reluctant to give unproven medications, especially ones that have pretty significant side effects like Chloroquine, but thats my 2 cents. My job in the ER is to stabilize you, and we have known methods to do that mostly around ventilation and intubation to help your lungs function. That's my clinical experience. After that, I am an informed scientist and I would only know based on whats published.

"Why do we not have better information about some basic questions everyone has:

1) does recovering from covid-19 confer immunity, at least until the virus mutates?

2) are asymptomatic patients infectious? I’ve read conflicting reports and having a reliable source for this is important 

3) does heat kill coronavirus? This seems like a simple piece of research that would be beneficial and assuage a lot of fears.  As we approach spring on the west coast, the temperature in cars is getting over 90F. As it gets even warmer it would be great to know if heat kills the virus. People can park in the sun to kill coronavirus in their cars, and leave the AC off during the day or all day as summer hits to kill coronavirus.","/u/backward_s 

1) This is a tricky question--I'll answer to say that there has been no evidence that people who get it once get it a second time (see our answer below). Thus to most people that would mean you have immunity. 

2) I have also read conflicing reports but my answer tends to be no.
The WHO notes that asymptomatic infection has been reported, but the majority of the relatively rare cases who are asymptomatic on the date of identification/report went on to develop disease. It’s important to note that the proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear since we aren’t yet widely testing asymptomatic patients, but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.

3) Heat doesn't kill it, but it does make it harder to spread. See my answer below about how long Coronavirus stays on surfaces. There is data that temps around 80-90 does make it harder to transmit.

Both my wife and I work in healthcare... if our schools close, how do we both continue to see patients when one of us has to stay home with the kids?  Sure, we can afford sitters, but demand is high and - more importantly - many of our coworkers (from nurses to the very important environmental staff that disinfect rooms of infected patients) often cannot.

Aside from taking the same hygiene precautions as everyone else, is there anything I should be watching out for if I do get infected? I don’t want to go to the hospital unnecessarily if I just get a cough but I also don’t want to, you know, die.","There’s two separate issues here, one is the shortness of breath you get from COVID, and the second is shortness of breath from Asthma. They can certainly go hand in hand and as you probably know from living with it, infections can exacerbate asthma. Specifically for COVID-19, people generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5-6 days after infection (mean incubation period 5-6 days, range 1-14 days). 

On top of that, you might actually start feeling short of breath because of asthma. We can definitely treat that--with steroids and nebulizers. You should make sure you keep these handy. If you start feeling more short of breath and your usual treatments (steroids, nebulizers) aren’t helping the way they normally do with your asthma (after all, you know your disease well!), call your doctor to get checked out. If you feel worse quickly, go directly to the hospital as asthma is still an emergency. We’ll answer the other symptoms question separately because its actually quite interesting and informative

"Do you see any value in taking vitamins as a precautionary measure? I'm currently taking Vitamins C & D, Zinc and Elderberry. Figure it couldn't hurt, just wondering if it's worth recommending to others.","So I actually looked this up for recent [Parents.com](https://www.parents.com/health/healthy-happy-kids/is-elderberry-really-good-for-kids-heres-what-parents-need-to-know/) piece. There actually is some evidence that Elderberry makes symptoms of a cold more tolerable, but there is no evidence it prevents infections. Keep in mind it also has to be boiled to prevent cyanide toxicity.

I think this whole discussion gets to two main points

1) I think in medicine we need to do a better job talking about patient-reported outcomes, or how you feel. We don’t have a lot of data on medicines and treatments that just make people feel better. I fully acknowledge that, but at the same time  I have been seeing a lot of talk about the idea of boosting your immune system, but keep in mind that a lot of the reasons why people get respiratory distress is that the immune system is too activated, causing a cytokine storm and causing death. A really overactive immune system is really quite harmful (Shuhan).
 
2) I think its more useful to talk about what makes you feel better, and what prevents illness, rather than what boosts your immune system.
In general, none of the home/over-the-counter medications you will take have yet been shown to decrease the duration of symptoms of COVID-19. 

They may, however, help you with your symptoms.  Decongestants may help with your nasal congestion and your cough, and anti-inflammatory medications (like acetaminophen and ibuprofen) will help with your fever.  

3) While vitamin supplements haven’t been shown to help either, there is currently a trial being proposed in Wuhan looking at high-dose Vitamin C and whether it helps patients who are severely ill.  However, the patients will receive 24 grams of IV vitamin C per day for 7 days. That's more than 260 times the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin C for adults and children age 4 years old and up, which is 90 mg per day.  I would caution everyone to NOT take anywhere close to this dose at home, and that vitamin C has not been proven to help patients with other forms of sepsis (a life threatening infection), but it still bears further study. If you get to this point, its probably better to come to the hospital. 

**TL;DR: Lots of medications help your symptoms. No medications really treat the root cause. Take medications because they make you feel better, not for your immune system.**",Emergencydocs,2020-03-11 14:24:36+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fgy7rg/im_dr_ali_raja_vice_chair_of_the_department_of/,"I’m Dr. Ali Raja, Vice Chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Mass General Hospital, and Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School.

"I continue to hear mixed advice on the use of masks. Some outlets have recommended against using them. Others say it can reduce my chances of getting COVID-19.

What is the complete answer about masks and COVID-19?","Masks can definitely decrease the risk for infection from COVID-19.  The thought is that it is transmitted via large droplets, which a mask should help prevent.  HOWEVER, we have a shortage of masks worldwide, so rather than making a large purchase of masks if you are young and healthy, it’s best to try to leave them for older patients or those with significant medical illnesses. Thats why you may be hearing mixed messages. We really need them for people who are at high risk of death and contracting COVID.

The reports about masks not working are really based around the fact that - at this time - the evidence is that more restrictive N-95 masks are necessary to prevent the virus’ transmission (this may change - we’ll be watching the CDC’s webpage for those of us in the U.S.).  These require specific fitting, as there are different sizes.  The surgical masks you see most people wearing don’t actually limit much airflow and may - instead - offer a false sense of security.

"How are pregnant women or newborns affected by this virus? Should I be even more concerned about them, and their safety? -My child isn't born yet, But could be in the next few weeks.

Thank you.","At this time, very little is known about COVID-19, particularly related to its effect on pregnant women and infants/newborns. There are two sources that we look at for this, and we’re all still making best informed guesses right now. Keep in mind we have limited data sets here to make decisions off of. However this question really is three separate questions that we’ll answer separately


**1) Are pregnant women at higher risk for severe disease?**

We look at The JAMA report from the 72,000 cases in Wuhan china 

“As opposed to Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk of severe disease. In an investigation of 147 pregnant women (64 confirmed, 82 suspected and 1 asymptomatic), 8% had severe disease and 1% were critical.”

However ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) looked at limited data from previous viruses like SARS and MERS (and COVID-19 is often thought of as SARS-2). Based on this, they may be a higher risk. Additionally, there is some data that suggests that there may have been cases of preterm birth in women in China who were infected with COVID-19. 

**TL;DR Right now we just don’t know how bad the risk is, so your friend should take (or not take) whatever action makes her feel more comfortable. As you can see its a bit contradictory.**

**2) Should I breastfeed?**

ACOG recommends against breastfeeding, as the concern is for respiratory droplet transmission during feeding. There has been no evidence to date yet showing transmission of virus in breastmilk. There have been a small number of cases in china where infants were found to test positive for the virus shortly after birth but it is unknown if this was from transplacental, droplet, or breast milk transmission. 

**TLDR Keep away from breastfeeding, not because of the milk, but because you would cough and sneeze on your baby.**


**3) Will this affect my baby?**

If we use old models like radiation, fetuses tend to be most susceptible to issues in the first trimester, but by the third trimester, since they’re mostly fully formed, it's probably safe. The highest infection rate in fetuses is in the first trimester for viruses and we’re thinking about it in those terms until better evidence proves or disproves us. At this point there is just no way to know.

**Overall TL;DR It’s probably safe, we think. The only way to know is once we start taking care of more children with COVID-19, so that we can track how they were infected. Don't breastfeed if you're sick**",Emergencydocs,2020-03-11 14:32:19+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fgy7rg/im_dr_ali_raja_vice_chair_of_the_department_of/,"I’m Dr. Ali Raja, Vice Chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Mass General Hospital, and Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School.

They actually tested this and there is data. Obviously, it does always vary depending on the type of surface, the amount of virus, and the temperature. 

It just sort of depends on the humidity and the type of surface. On different types of materials it can remain infectious for from 2 hours up to 9 days.

On the lower end, it lasts only about 2 hours on paper surfaces but can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days. For plastic, its about 6-9 days. There isn’t a clear idea of cell phone screens specifically, but for glass it's about 5 days. 

A higher temperature such as 80 degrees F reduced the duration of how long it persists for.

Similar viruses like SARS and MERS also show about the same time frame, so we think this is pretty accurate.

How do you self quarantine basically? What is the time period for that and what happens if you exceed that time period without any noticeable improvements?,"So, first, some definitions.  Remember that quarantine isolates people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 to see if they get sick, whereas isolation is a way to separate an already sick person from people who aren't sick. Quarantines last for as long as the upper limit of the virus' incubation (the time between being exposed and showing symptoms), which the CDC is saying should be 14 days.  After that, if you’re still not showing any symptoms, you should be in the clear. Isolation lasts for as long as the virus is contagious, which means until people are free of symptoms and test negative for the virus


So specifically to answer the question how do you self quarantine if you’ve been asked to do so? 

* Stay away from other people in your home as much as possible, staying in a separate room and using a separate bathroom if available.

* No visitors unless the person needs to be in your home. Especially visitors who are elderly and frail.

* If you need medical attention (whether it’s for COVID-19 symptoms or for any other medical emergency), call ahead to ensure you're going to the right place and so that they can take the necessary precautions to isolate you when you arrive. Tell the EMT and tell the doctors early so we don't get sick from you!

* Wear a face mask if you must be around other people, such as during a drive to the doctor's office (We're answering the face mask question in another area)

* Avoid sharing household items, including drinking cups, eating utensils, towels or even bedding. Wash these items thoroughly after using.

* Clean high-touch surfaces daily using a household cleaner or wipe. These include: ""counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables,"" the CDC says.[ Shuhan did a piece about it here,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clean-phones-ya-filthy-animals-232103183.html) I'll cite the table in another answer. The virus can stay on surfaces for 6-9 days! 

* Clean any surfaces that may be contaminated with blood, stool or any bodily fluids. This should be obvious for any situation, not just COVID

* This one is really important: Continue monitoring your symptoms. If they worsen, such as you if you begin to have difficulty breathing,, and especially if you have trouble breathing while speaking ,that is your sign to go to the ER immediately. 

- Keep in mind: when you begin the quarantine, you should have one set up for you to check in with regularly. Worst case is you are alone in an emergency.

"I'm particularly worried about ***Virus Mutation***

How likely is the Coronavirus to mutate, and at what rate? Is it a mutation that restricts the possibility of a one-time vaccine? Is there a possibility that the virus may very well become a seasonal pandemic that mimics the seasonal cycle of the flu? 

*Kindly explain this issue as it is a cause for concern for many of us.*","Coronaviruses, like influenza, are RNA viruses, which means they are more prone to mutation than other types of viruses. 

With influenza, these mutations happen so often that it forces us to make a new vaccine each year to tackle the evolving strains. Hard to know if the same will apply for the novel coronavirus, given a vaccine has not been developed yet.  

But not all mutations are beneficial mutations. While the novel coronavirus is certainly changing in its genetic makeup in real-time, this habit doesn't automatically mean that the virus is becoming more dangerous. Here are a couple resources about that:  
[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0690-4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0690-4)

You could expect additional travel bans and large-scale quarantines, which would likely lead to mass migrations of people who do not want to get stuck behind the restrictions. Those mass movements could work against the effectiveness of infection control strategies.   
In the long-term, if the virus spreads widely, we might expect governments to move away from quarantine methods and divert resources primarily toward medical treatment.",nationalgeographic,2020-03-12 12:11:40+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fhhoci/im_nsikan_akpan_a_science_editor_at_national/,"I’m Nsikan Akpan, a science editor at National Geographic covering the COVID-19 outbreak—AMA",https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus,
How long does it generally take for herd immunity to form on a new virus? How exactly does that occur?,"This question is tricky, because what you're really asking is ""What is the **herd immunity threshold** for the novel coronavirus?""  


The **herd immunity threshold** is the percentage of the population that needs to develop resistance to a disease in order to stop transmission chains between people. You can find one of my favorite illustrations of this concept [here](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/science-health-public-trust/perspectives/science-health-public-trust/building-trust-vaccines).   


But this threshold varies by disease. For measles, you need 90-95% of the population to have immunity, either through vaccination or naturally through infection, for effective herd immunity. For mumps, it is 75-86% 

Those thresholds are dependent on transmission rates, as others describe in this thread, but it also depends on how/if our bodies can develop long-lasting immunity to the disease. That, in turn, that depends on the virus' evolution but also on how our bodies respond to the virus. 

For example, the seasonal flu virus mutates so fast that we need a new vaccine each year. Even then the vaccine is only 50% effective, which factors into why it is hard to build complete herd immunity against influenza. For dengue, there are multiple strains of the virus, they circle back at random times to spawn outbreaks, and our bodies can't seem to develop immunity that can cover all of them.   


We need to learn more about all of these matters before we can know if herd immunity is possible for COVID-19 and how fast it might occur.",nationalgeographic,2020-03-12 17:30:37+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fhhoci/im_nsikan_akpan_a_science_editor_at_national/,"I’m Nsikan Akpan, a science editor at National Geographic covering the COVID-19 outbreak—AMA",https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus,

"How likely is it this virus mutates? How does a virus mutate and why does a virus mutate?
- Thank you in advance","It's in the nature of viruses to mutate. They copy themselves many times and when they do this they will likely make a 'typo'! They simply put the wrong base in place when making a copy.

So yes - the virus will mutate, and is mutating. But this isn't alarming at all.

&#x200B;

The important thing to remember is that these mutations are largely non-functional. They do not make the virus better or worse in any way (contrary to the movies!). Most mutations do nothing, as I said, the next most likely is that they are deleterious - bad for the virus. These viruses won't replicate and thus they won't leave offspring. 

&#x200B;

The cool thing about mutations it that this allows us to track them! Mutations that are the same in two viruses indicate they came from an ancestor with the same mutations. This is exactly how we put the viruses together into a 'tree' on [nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)!",emmademiology,2020-03-13 12:11:00+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fi14db/we_are_four_swiss_scientists_studying/,We are four Swiss scientists studying COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 - AMA!,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus,
"In your opinion, which country has had the best response so far?","In my opinion - South Korea. They have had a big outbreak! However in the last few days they seem to have stabilised cases without taking severe measures (lockdown) that cause social and economic damage. Here's what they've done

\- Strongly encouraged work-from-home - this includes supporting businesses by providing compensation per employee for lost profit due to home working, and making grants available for small business, and 'resuming business' when this is all over.

\- Giving employees extra sick paid sick leave and extra leave for caring for sick relatives

\- Closing schools, but providing free childcare to health care workers & critical workers and those who can't work from home - classes < 10 , or even personal care if needed

\- Cancelling and discouraging large events & gatherings, & unnecessary travel

\- Finally, they **really really ramped up testing**. It's widely available, free, and fast (6 hours results).   
Why does this make a difference? Because we know you can have this virus and be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and can also transmit the virus before you develop symptoms. This means those people go around doing their normal things, and infect others. If people know early on that they are infected, they can go self-isolate - this has a huge impact on transmissions. 

This is why I say: **TEST TEST TEST!**",emmademiology,2020-03-13 12:44:56+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fi14db/we_are_four_swiss_scientists_studying/,We are four Swiss scientists studying COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 - AMA!,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus,
How long will this virus stick around?

&#x200B;

In short - we don't know the impact of seasonality. For this preprint we looked at the effect of seasonality that we inferred from other coronaviruses, and applied it to the pandemic COVID-19. It is possible that this virus could become seasonal, but we don't know this for certain.

"I follow you all on twitter and love your work. What is your best guess CFR? And we are hearing some reports of younger patients in serious situations. Is the narrative that it only kills the elderly wrong, or are those cases an exception to the data? Have we just not seen enough young people to see the final clinical endpoint?","Thank you for your kind words! CFR is really hard to estimate - it's a slippery number. It depends  a lot on the state of the healthcare system, who is infected, and the number of cases that are being detected (to make the denominator). If a lot of cases are going untested, and only serious cases are, this will lead to a higher CFR. Also, if health systems are overwhelmed so people can't even get basic healthcare, this will also affect CFR.

&#x200B;

This virus is \*most risky\* to the elderly, but it can certainly kill younger people too - even without pre-existing conditions. We aren't entirely sure why yet. It does seem that younger people are at *much less risk* than the elderly, but this definitely shouldn't be passed off as a 'disease of the elderly'.

&#x200B;

Perhaps even more importantly, young people can be 'fine' and transmit the virus to vulnerable populations!",emmademiology,2020-03-13 12:24:15+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fi14db/we_are_four_swiss_scientists_studying/,We are four Swiss scientists studying COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 - AMA!,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus,
I have seen so many reports that it's the disease that will kill everything or that it's just a bad flu. I have heard so much misinformation that I dont even know what the misinformation is anymore. Just give it to me straight. Do I need to start preparing for the apocalypse or will it all blow over in a month or 2?,"I agree, the misinformation about this has not helped the situation. I'm not very happy with those who are said it's a 'bad flu' - this is something we've now had to counter. For one thing, people don't seem to realise how many people a 'bad flu' can kill in a year! 

This virus is one worth being alert about. Whether for yourself personally I can't say - if you are young and healthy you will \*probably\* be fine (though note that it does kill young, healthy people).  However what's definitely true is that we can all put vulnerable people at risk, and that there's a real risk this virus moves so quickly, that it infects a lot of people who do get severe infections, and this overwhelms hospitals (see Italy, Wuhan).

This won't be the apocalypse - we won't run out of food. Society won't collapse. But it might need to function difficulty for a while - perhaps fewer delivery drivers can work, so we might need to have a few days for systems to adjust. You might not be able to get your favourite brand of yogurt. But you won't starve. This is why people are advising a little prep now - if you don't have to go to the shop for a few days you give the system 'slack' to adjust - so that they can adjust deliveries and not cause more problems.",emmademiology,2020-03-13 13:03:05+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fi14db/we_are_four_swiss_scientists_studying/,We are four Swiss scientists studying COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 - AMA!,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus,
What are one (1) very serious concern and one (1) encouraging statements you'd say about the virus?,"1) That countries are not reacting very quickly. This is starting to change in the past few days. However, I think Europe & America have a real chance to slow transmission and have a 'South Korea' approach (see one of my other answers), and there is a limited opportunity to do this. In particular I've been baffled by the US slowness to acknowledge the severity of the disease and ramp up testing. I'm still afraid testing is far below the necessary capacity in the US. 

2) The scientific response to the virus has been hugely inspiring. We've never known so much about an epidemic this early into it. Sequencing is fast & cheap, scientists are sharing data quickly & openly, and we are using preprints and tools like [nextstrain.org/ncov](https://nextstrain.org/ncov) and twitter to share data and critique analyses in real time. Everyone is helping everyone in whatever way they can.  It's really been inspiring.",emmademiology,2020-03-13 12:50:04+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fi14db/we_are_four_swiss_scientists_studying/,We are four Swiss scientists studying COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 - AMA!,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus,
What do you all make of the UKs plan to adopt herd immunity?,"Personally I am sceptical of this plan. I agree that we cannot 'stop' this virus now - it will be spreading in the population for a while (there will be many undetected cases circulating in the UK already, right now). That means that we **will** build up some level of immunity as a population.

The problem with herd immunity is that you need a \*lot\* of people to have it before its effective. That means openly deciding that you will allow a really large proportion of the population to get it - like 70% or more (usually you need more). You might say, ok just the young people get it, and the 30% is everyone over age XX. However, we know this virus \*does\* kill young people - even healthy ones.

So, if you let this virus infect every person under 65... and assume a fairly low estimate of CFR of 0.1% - what do the numbers tell you for the numbers dead? And this assumes we perfectly isolate all those over 65 - which is pretty difficult. (And what about those who have other conditions that make them vulnerable?)

I think the idea that we know enough about the virus to so carefully and preceicly control its spread in a way that would lead to this plan being successful is arrogant. We do not know the virus that well, and we cannot control spread so exactly.

However, I think we can seriously limit the spread and the speed of spread, by taking action now to limit social contacts and large groups, etc.",emmademiology,2020-03-13 12:39:55+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fi14db/we_are_four_swiss_scientists_studying/,We are four Swiss scientists studying COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 - AMA!,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus,
I believe a correctly worn mask will assist in preventing getting infected by someone else.  I know others who do not agree.  Can you clear it up please?  Thanks.,"The issue is that wearing a mask 'correctly' is really difficult. More difficult than most people understand. And unless it's an N95 mask, it's not really doing much good. 

I strongly do not recommend people buy the N95 masks. There have been reports of shortages, and this means that those who really need them - health care workers, and researchers working on the virus - can't get them. Trust me, that's bad news.  
They are also really, really hard to wear properly - most people don't have proper training (and from reading threads about the training - it's hard!). They are hot and uncomfortable, and have to fit really tight. You can't touch the outside, even when removing. Most people can't do this, they get uncomfortable and adjust them and take them off all the time - and so they end up being useless. So, a waste of a limited resource.

The more common surgical masks can be helpful for sick people, as they do contain coughs and sneezes. However, again, on the balance they are a limited resource for other medical workers. I would recommend wearing them if sick but not if well, unless you are sure there are plenty.   


Masks can also give a false sense of confidence - people then tend to not wash their hands more, to go out more, to get closer to people... all with a mask that isn't really helping.",emmademiology,2020-03-13 12:21:39+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fi14db/we_are_four_swiss_scientists_studying/,We are four Swiss scientists studying COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 - AMA!,https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus,

How do I respond to people who post things like “if we just quarantine the high-risk people and then let everyone else get it and recover, we will develop herd immunity”.  It’s really frustrating because the people who post those arguments are using their theory as an excuse to break the self-isolation directives and are going out and interacting closely with people and basically acting like honeybees pollinating people flowers with Coronavirus.  Any advice or resources for urging our friends who subscribe to this theory to follow public health directives?","Things you could say to your friends:

The virus is spreading through us like wildfire. It will kill hundreds if not thousands every day. Can you imagine a terrorist attack a day killing 500 people for weeks on end? If you could help stop it, would you?

If there's a bit more time to explain, then maybe tell them that even if you are young, you are still at risk. You may have a horrible illness, you may end up in ICU on a ventilator, you might die.

But maybe you will be one of the lucky ones and get mild symptoms only. Maybe you have it now and don't know it.

Well - consider someone like you who does have it. You feel fine. You think ""Hey, this is OK, I'm going to go out and socialise, what's the harm?"". Every-time you go out, you will pass these virus particles onto other people, even if you are careful. You have it on your hands, on your clothes. You touch a surface or open a door? You'll leave virus there for days for other people to pick up. And suddenly two or three more people have the virus.

Maybe they are lucky too and don't get much in the way of symptoms, and maybe one of them thinks ""hey, this is OK, I'm going to go out as well, what's the harm?"". And then they also spread it.

And one or two transmissions down the line, someone who is vulnerable, or just unlucky, maybe your mother or your grandfather, will get it and need a ventilator or die.

It's not about protecting yourself, it's about protecting everyone in the population. And these measures only work if EVERYONE chips in and does them.

You are used to reading about catastophe in other places in the world. You might think it's like a film, or sometimes entertainment. Well, this is not that - this is happening to you. Right now.

It will take sacrifice, but really not that much. How spoilt are you to think that you are entitled to have a beer, or a picnic, or a trip to the countryside, or a lie down on the beach, or to have a party with some mates? How pampered and dependent on luxury are you? It is NOT a right. 

People in developing countries have had it much, much worse. Some have isolated and starved to death under a lock-down. They have died in droves because they have no healthcare facilities. Elderly and even middle-aged patients in Italy have been refusing ventilators so they will be available to younger patients.

The older you and the more pre-existing conditions you have, the less chance you have of making it to intensive care.

"There's been a lot of confusion regarding the UK government policy re Herd Immunity and being contradicted by different officials. Was this ever part of the administrations plan, or was it just a miscommunication from BoJo? I understand if you don't have details and are the wrong person to ask.","I'm sad to say that I do have the details, and there has been intense discussion about this over the past weeks. To answer your question: ""herd immunity"" would have been a beneficial outcome to slowing virus growth to a prolonged period of time. It was not a primary outcome.

That said, the official policy was wholly wrong and when all the dust has settled, when all the costs and lives have been counted, people have to make their governments accountable.

I'll tell you what happened in the UK.

Over the past decade, eminent figures in public health developed complex models that would help inform the UK response to a pandemic. The response plan would allow slow spread through a population and a number of deaths that would be deemed acceptable in relation to low economic impact. Timing of population measures such as social distancing would be taken, not early, but at a times deemed to have maximal psychological impact. Measures would be taken that could protect the most vulnerable, and most of the people who got the virus would hopefully survive. Herd immunity would beneficially emerge at the end of this, and restrictions could relax. This was a ground-breaking approach compared to suppressing epidemics. It was an approach that could revolutionise the way we handled epidemics. Complex modelling is a new science, and this was cutting edge.

But a model is only ever as good as the assumptions you build it upon. The UK plan was based on models with an assumption that any new pandemic would be like an old one, like flu. And it also carried a huge flaw - there was no accounting for the highly significant variables of ventilators and critical care beds that are key to maintaining higher survival numbers ([https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/03/government-documents-show-no-planning-ventilators-event-pandemic](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/03/government-documents-show-no-planning-ventilators-event-pandemic)).

So, come 2020 and COVID-19 causes disaster in China, Iran and Italy. Epidemiologists and doctors from around the world observe, and learn valuable lessons:

1. the virus is insidious with a long incubation, any population actions you take will only have an effect weeks later
2. the virus spreads remarkably quickly and effectively
3. **the virus causes an unusually large proportion of patients to require invasive ventilatory support**
4. early large scale testing, and social distancing measures, are effective at stopping exponential growth
5. **stopping exponential growth is VITAL to preventing your critical care systems from being overwhelmed.**

Everyone in the world could see these things. But despite this, very few governments chose to act.

The UK did the opposite of acting. In an act of what I see as sheer arrogance, they chose to do nothing, per the early stages of their disaster plan. There was some initial contact tracing, but this stopped when it was clear that there was significant community spread and exponential growth. And after this? They did not ramp up testing capabilities. They did not encourage social distancing. They did not boost PPE supply, or plan for surge capacity. They ignored advice from the WHO, public health experts in other country; epidemiologists, scientists and doctors in their own. I can tell you with certainty now that they did not even collect regular statistics for how many COVID patients were being admitted to critical care in the UK. They did nothing.

What were they thinking? Maybe that what had happened in China, and was happening in Italy, couldn't possibly happen in the UK, right? It was **impossible**. The persisted with the original plan with no modification. 

Well COVID-19 is not flu. That is perfectly clear. And it was clear that the UK numbers were following, exponentially, the same trend as Italy. But still the government and their advisers stuck to their guns and put out reassuring messages. I would ask here - **why did they still think we would be different?**

Finally, a team at Imperial informing the government's response put up-to-date COVID-19 data into the historical models that the UK plan was based on ([https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf)), and predicted in a best case scenario 250,000 deaths and excess of 8x surge capacity of UK intensive cares. They concluded that our approach was wrong, and that ""Epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time"".

Where are we now?

1. The government has instituted a number of measures that they previously called ""unscientific"", but has not mandated them.
2. We are far, far into the exponential curve both in deaths and critical care numbers, and there is at least two weeks more growth until any of the half-hearted measures taken might kick in.
3. We do not have sufficient testing capability for even hospital patients, who sometimes wait days for a test result. There are not enough tests for anyone in the community, or any healthcare workers who might have symptoms.
4. Hospitals are scrambling to produce surge capacity, and several smaller hospitals in London are now overwhelmed with COVID and out of ventilators.
5. There is clearly not enough PPE in the country and we are rushing to secure supplies.

Don't believe the UK government propaganda when they say that they are only advancing along the same plan at a faster pace. It is total bollocks. Their plan was wrong, kaput, totally broken. They chose to perform an experiment on an entire population, a trial of 'new epidemic mitigation strategy in UK' vs 'epidemic suppression in rest of the world'. They didn't listen to other experts from all over the world, and in this arrogance they did not observe the lessons or data that was there, plain to see. **They have backtracked completely and are now doing what most world public health experts and what the WHO asked them to do in the first place.** They've wasted a month, at least.

Will they suffer? Hell no. It will be the vulnerable in the population, the unlucky young, and the medical staff at the front line.

It started off that for all swab confirmed positive patients would would be wearing FFP3 masks, theatre cap, visor with long-sleeved gown and taped gloves.

We very quickly ran out of FFP3 masks and visors.

So for 1. it would be surgical mask and apron. For 2. it would be FFP3, visor and gown.

PPE is in very short supply, and various things run out on a daily basis, but we have been assured that supply chains are being established and the situation will get better.

What we need are controlled trials - a trial compares a patient receiving the drug, to a patient with similar characteristics who didn't receive it, and with enough patients, you can find a signal of effectiveness. 

We do not have enough data yet to know what might be effective. There is data from in vitro studies (which often do not translate to an effect in humans), there is anecdotal data from case series, and there are a couple of very small, very poor quality trials, none of which actually demonstrate effectiveness.

That's not to say we wont try to use them as long as they are safe. Ritonavir/Lopinavir was used a lot by the Chinese but initial trial data was not promising. The Italians have been using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, particularly in earlier stage patients. Another promising drug is Remdesivir, which several UK centres are using in critically ill patients (although it is becoming extremely difficult to secure).

There are trials currently in progress, and a large WHO trial which as just been launched that will hopefully give us some answers.

Predicting that GB will have 100x as many deaths as have happened in China, in a country with a population 5% the size of China, so per capita 2000x as many deaths, sounds quite incredible.

"Like most people, my anxiety surrounding this virus has been steadily ramping up over the last few months.

It is not airborne, like measles, which can float in the air up to 100 feet. This coronavirus is transmitted by airborne droplets, so it doesn't float, and drops off as the droplets fall, in about 6 feet. It can also be transmitted on surfaces, which are called fomites.

Why did the 1918 pandemic stop infecting the population? Did it lessen in severity or immunity and it didn't mutate?,"The 1918 pandemic essentially ran out of susceptible people to infect. There is an epidemiological model called the SIR model (for Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) that models how viruses (or other pathogens) move through a population. Susceptibles are those exposed (in the line of fire, could depend a lot on behavior) in which the virus can get a foot hold (depends on biological properties including immune status), at which point the Susceptible becomes Infected, stays in this bucket for a while, then moves into Recovered (hopefully) and potentially immune (TBD with this virus). In the case of the 1918 Spanish flu, people that recovered did develop protective immunity.

However, genetic elements of the 1918 Spanish flu did assemble into new combinations with other flu strains (we call this reassortment) and showed up in the H1N1 swine flu virus and pandemic of 2009.",MicrobeExplorer,2020-03-19 12:51:49+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/flbwei/im_shannon_bennett_a_virologist_focused_on/,"I'm Shannon Bennett, a virologist focused on emerging infectious diseases, here to talk about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19.

The R0 or reproductive rate of the virus (related to how fast it spreads) and case fatality rate have both had preliminary estimates that range higher than seasonal flu. In terms of disease, both flu and coronavirus cause immune disregulation (and ultimately possible death by cytokine storm), but the pathways in our cells seem to be different ... all of this is still emerging knowledge - we don't know enough!

Lastly, flu has become a regular infectious agent for humans, cycling in the temperate zone seasonally and at low levels year-round in the tropics.

Would weather conditions have any effect on mutation of coronavirus?,"Not directly. Mutations are actually occurring all the time to DNA and RNA, no matter what the organism, based on error rates at the chemical level when the genetic strand is being copied for replication, or due to a mutagen, like UV radiation or a carcinogenic chemical. Most mutations are lethal and kill the cell or virus (viruses aren't cellular). When a mutation persists in the progeny, we call that evolution. Sometimes these evolutionary changes are neutral and don't confer any particular fitness benefit, sometimes they can be even bad for the organism under certain conditions, and sometime they can confer a fitness benefit. The larger the population size, the more variants.

So, with many viruses that are seasonal in the temperate zone, they are seasonal because humans cluster together in warm dry rooms with recirculated air, increasing their own susceptible population size artificially, as well as by extension the virus population size. Larger population size of the viruses, larger amount of standing genetic variation, more opportunity for a potential beneficial mutation to occur that could eventually become fixed in the virus population - more fit virus, usually not so good for us.",MicrobeExplorer,2020-03-19 13:03:56+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/flbwei/im_shannon_bennett_a_virologist_focused_on/,"I'm Shannon Bennett, a virologist focused on emerging infectious diseases, here to talk about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19.

Maybe a dumb question. But why can't we swab our own mouths and test ourselves? What's in the test kits? Can we not look at our own culture samples through a microscope at home to see if we have the virus?,"No dumb questions!

Yes, in theory you could collect your own mouth swabs but you would need to send them in, because the current test is based on detecting the genetics of the virus by a polymerase chain reaction that uses coronavirus-matching molecules and other reagents to amplify fragments of the virus genome (accelerate its replication) for detection through a series of cycles (e.g. 30) that typically alternate between 95 celsius to 55-65 celsius to 75 celsius. In summary, this is a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction \[aka real-time RT-PCR\] that includes short sequences of DNA (primers and probes) that bind exclusively to SARS-CoV-2 matching sequence and give off, once bound, a detectable fluorescent signal whose brightness matches the number of binding events aka virus fragments. Although the [test parameters are now open access](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/index.html) you would need this fancy real-time PCR machine plus a centrifuge plus a biosafety cabinet...

The good news is that many folks are working on different kinds of tests, maybe even a protein-based test that could be bundled into a system like a pregnancy test kit, and you could use this RAPID test kit at home...

Normal microscopes won't help because viruses are too small to reflect light (this coronavirus, if it is like others in the family Coronaviridae, is probably on the order of 120 nanometers \[a nanometer is a billionth of a meter in diameter) - you need to use an electron microscope that fires electrons at the virus and reads their reflections.",MicrobeExplorer,2020-03-19 13:29:38+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/flbwei/im_shannon_bennett_a_virologist_focused_on/,"I'm Shannon Bennett, a virologist focused on emerging infectious diseases, here to talk about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19.

I don't know of any other ways to prevent spread than what is currently talked about: protect yourself from being a host by washing your hands, not touching your face, and maintaining a social distance of at least 6 feet except from people you live with; protect people from you as a transmitter by self-isolating (and calling your doctor) if you're experiencing flu-like symptoms plus all of the above.

Happily, because the data on this virus, especially the genetics, has been open-source, many labs are using the information to explore vaccine candidates.

2) If I order a hot dish from a restaurant as takeout, and the person cooking, preparing, or delivering my dish was sick, am I at significantly increased risk? 


3) Does *exhaustive* exercise (iike running on a treadmill for 3-4 hours) increase or decrease my body's ability to fight off a virus?","Thanks for asking. Here is Dr. Sharfstein's reply:

 There are different perspectives on whether hotter water is better. CDC recommends warm or cold water. See: https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-handwashing.html 

-- The bottom line is wash hands with soap X 20 seconds at key points and even if you just feel like it.

2) There is some evidence emerging of the potential for ""fecal-oral"" transmission of the virus, which means it could be passed on by people who don't wash their hands well after going to the bathroom. For this reason, some people might suggest sticking to cooked food, rather than uncooked food, for ordering out. Also super important that restaurant workers wash their hands. Restaurants should take extra steps and assure their customers. And people ordering should wash their hands well before eating.

"My country aswell as other european countries take action to control the spread of the virus, planning for a slow but steady spread of the virus throughout the population. Anyone, but especially the elderly and those with comorbidities are at risk of being hospitalized from this virus. 

Others have a higher chance of none to mild symptoms, able to get better at home over a certain period. This group however, will not be tested for the virus in my country and we will have to rely on estimates from our healthservices to establish how widespread the infection is. 

To my question: as the description mentions this will mean a lack of true reliable info on:
- the percentage of people, from whatever age group, requiring hospitalization.
- the symptoms people with ""mild complaints"" suffer from, on average. (As this can vary alot, from agonizing headaches, fever and chest pain to virtually no symptoms)

Thank you","Data nerd here! Generally speaking, data quality tends to be better earlier in outbreaks because officials and researchers have more time to keep track of the details. As cases spike, it becomes less of a priority and more difficult to maintain the same level of detail. ""Line listing"" data is what most infectious disease experts are working with right now to try to answer the big questions, like those you mention. Groups like The MIDAS Network are compiling data and research results. It's not just the data quality that can affect the figures you see. Demographics of any given country, access to health care, underlying conditions, etc. vary between nation. For instance, we generally see older people as more likely to need hospitalization but we don't know yet if that's purely a function of age or because older people tend to have more underlying conditions, like heart disease. Results also might vary if the country's had different treatment strategies.

"There’s a bunch of misinformation going around and it’s hard to find any true answers so I wanted to ask.

1. How bad is it really? 

2. What will the US look like cases/death wise by the end of this?

3. What must happen now to stop the spread?","1. Right now, not as bad as it will be. How bad it gets ultimately depends on several factors, including: length of and diligence to mitigation measures, availability of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, whether this virus is seasonal, and demographics in the communities where cases spread. For quick comparison, less than 1% of people who get the typical flu end up hospitalized at any level. So far, about 5% of people with COVID-19 have needed intensive care, including a ventilator. 
2. Studies analyzing the % of deaths in various Chinese communities have reported death rates between 2% and 10%. It's very tough to know what could happen in the US, including for the reasons in No. 1. That said, here's some back-of-the-napkin math: If 7.4% of Americans are infected -- the infection rate for the most mild flu season in the U.S. in the last 5 years -- that would be about 24 million infections. If 2% die, that's 480,000 deaths. 
3. There is no real way to ""stop"" spread in the U.S. at this point. We can slow the spread so we don't overwhelm health workers and we can do our best to prevent the spread from reaching vulnerable people. Social distancing and good hygiene are the best things we can do as individuals. The tough part is that we, as individuals and businesses and governments, make decisions on more than medical outcomes alone.

It seems the constant theme with the way our government has prepared for this has been ""too little, too late"".

So we might see different outcomes in different places. Medical equipment is something that's been heavily discussed by providers and with states making requests from the national stockpile.

We are asked to work after being afebrile for 24 hours. 
We have not geolocalized our ICU for covid patients yet so they are in all the icus with potential exposure to other patients and staff. 
I’m not sure what the best way to go is, but I don’t think we are doing the best job for our people and our patients. 
What do you think? What is your ideal scenario? What can we do better?do you think surgical masks are enough for health care providers given healthy Chinese doctors ( in the 20s) have died from this while wearing Hazmat suits?","It certainly sounds like not ideal circumstances. I would keep advancing your concerns up the administrative ladder. 

We have isolated an entire floor in our main hospital (ICU and floor beds) for coronavirus and have dedicated specific ORs for them if they need surgery. We are reserving our N95 and PAPRs only for confirmed Covid-19 cases, because otherwise we will run out. (Apparently Columbia University has run out of masks because they used them all up in the first 4 days due to huge volumes of suspected Covid-19 patients). 

I would certainly be persistent with your concerns until changes are made.

"Bit of an unusual question here. 


I’m a private practice Neurosurgery physician assistant at a large hospital in NJ. Our MICU is full, the SICU is starting to add vented covid or suspected covid patients, the medical step down is now full of non-covid ICU patients and the orthopedic nurses are being pulled to medical step down beds that are being created from other units.  It’s only been 10 days since our first case...

My team is not hospital employed but we are close with the Surgical ICU team and have at least some experience managing critical patients. We all feel like if the medicine teams call for help we should do our best to answer but none of us us much experience with vents, vasopressors or ARDS at this point. I’ve been perusing my old copy of The ICU Book but I’m at last coming to my question, any resources you recommend to get someone up to speed as quickly as possible to at least help medical teams in dealing with critical Covid cases?  Speaking with some critical care friends/residents they do not have enough staff and will need help pretty soon. Meanwhile our service is quiet because elective surgery is cancelled.","First of all, you are awesome. Thank you for stepping up and helping us out. 

At this point, there is little time to learn the basics of critical care and what I would focus on is learning as much about Covid-19 specific treatments as you can.

Sorry, just being hopeful and thank you for doing what you do.","I would say she is at high risk of contracting the disease and unfortunately definitely not a lower mortality risk. We are not using immunosuppressants as a treatment as far as I know (would love to see your sources). The Chinese use steroids, a type of immunosuppressant, for treatment, but that's likely because their standard of care for treating Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) utilizes steroids. ARDS is what most of the patients with severe Covid-19 infection experience. In the U.S. generally we do not treat ARDS with steroids unless under particular circumstances. Use of steroids in ARDS is associated with increased superimposed infections, especially fungal infections.

I am from the netherlands and we currently have the approach to limit social activity. We are however not in ‘lockdown’ since our icus are still able to handle the load. Ive read many times online that this ‘herd immunity’ theory is stupid and that we are doing it all wrong. However, from my limited understanding i dont know why this would be so wrong. As long as our icus are able to handle the load this is the right response since the virus has to go ‘through’ the whole population before this is over correct? Why do you say that we should just all stay inside. Wouldnt this be counter productive since the moment we all go back outside the virus will come back?

Also, since this virus is supposed to be spread via ‘liquid particles’, how does a healthy person without any symptoms (no coughing, runny nose etc) infect others. If you are not coughing you cannot spread it right? Thanks!","Well, the thought is that a vaccine would emerge in time to help give immunity without having to get the actual disease. Remember that herd immunity doesn't require infection with the actual, live virus.

If you wipe your nose on your sleeve, then your sleeve on a surface, and someone else comes and touches that surface, the 'liquid particles' can be transferred that way.

"What physically happens to the patients who need to be intubated/ICU'd? I know the details of intubation and care, but what are the symptoms that the covid-patient goes through causing a need for intubation?

Do the lungs collapse, does the nervous system malfunction, are they overheated due to fever, etc?","Great question, thank you.

Essentially most of these patients get ARDS (clarification - most of the patients that are in the ICU with covid-related illness) - acute respiratory distress syndrome - in which there is massive inflammation of lung tissue in response to the virus, which ends up ""flooding"" the lungs (pulmonary edema), and making it hard to get blood from the lungs to the heart (pulmonary hypertension). This inflammation leads to scarring, and the alveoli (air sacs that exchange gases) are involved, making oxygenation difficult. This usually requires intubation to provide high concentration of oxygen at (usually) higher pressures. Overinflating the lung or providing too much pressure with each breath can, at this point, cause irreversible damage.

For those that survive the pulmonary ordeal (younger patients, it seems), there is a cardiac phase, in which the virus causes weakness of the heart, so that it can't properly distribute blood to the body (the heart may pump only 10% of the blood within it versus 60% normally). This heart failure can be lethal as it may cause decreased delivery of oxygen to the heart itself (leading to heart attacks), or other organs, like the kidneys (kidney failure requiring short- or long-term dialysis) or strokes from poor perfusion of the brain.",drdrintensivistmdphd,2020-03-18 15:33:03+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fkpjjh/hello_i_am_an_anesthesiologist_icu_physician_and/,"Hello, I am an anesthesiologist, ICU physician, and have a PhD in Pharmacology.

2. What have you heard about the implications of finding the virus in CSF? There was a case study out of China where pts readmitted, 45% of ICU pts had LP which tested positive for Covid19.

4. Is this a new normal for the next 18 or so months until a viable vaccine is approved? Should we come to terms with the prospect of having a flu season AND a SARS-Covid season indefinitely?

5. What about antibody therapies which give passive immunity in the meantime? Could those be implemented to buy us time until vaccines are a go?","1.

"I work for a fortune 500 company in a major US city that has been heavily affected by the virus. There’s about 500 employees in my office, not including our warehouse attached. 90% of the office jobs can be done from home. My job and my team specifically were never allowed to do from home, but there were some positions in the office were allowed to work from hole before.

The company has decided to resume operations as normal, minus the warnings for how to prevent viral spread, and adding some more and sanitizer around the building. In addition, the people who used to be able to work from home are now on mandatory office attendance since Monday. Essentially they have forced everyone in the building to be here at once everyday.

2 people on my team have pre-existing conditions that could be a risk for them by catching the virus. Their options were pto or unpaid leave. I’m sure there’s similar cases as such around the office.

How can I convey to my managers (so they can convey up the chain) the importance that we are not contained in this environment?

Side note: the company has the money to invest in temporary work from home programs

Side note 2: the lady who sat in the cubicle across from me had called in sick. She had symptoms of the virus but was not tested as she did not meet the dangerous criteria, and told to self-quarantine for 14 days. Our company is aware of this, and taken no action.

"Hi thank you for doing this!  


I have a question about social distancing.  My question is why not implement a hybrid of our social distancing method and the tragically flawed British ""herd immunity"" method?   


It seems like we're fighting a losing battle w/ social distancing since as soon as we stop shacking up (which for economic/sanity reasons seems inevitable) the virus would spread as normal (and there's no way we can maintain this for 18 months which is how long it would take to get a vaccine).

&#x200B;

We start exposing young healthy people to the virus and then put them in full isolation (which is basically what we're in right now). After this, it seems we'll have more and more people with antibodies/immunity who can actively aide the community/deliver food/go back to work without concern.  


Is there a reason not to do measured exposure with already isolated individuals? Or is the assumption that the natural spread of the virus will essentially do this over time anyway?","Unfortunately, young, healthy people are not immune from this disease. We have a 30s-year-old with no medical problems in the ICU. Dallas has a 20 year old and 30 year old intubated in critical condition. Italy has had a number of young, healthy people die. 30 year old doctors in China have died.

"Hi Doc.

Bit of a stupid question here. What does a ventilator need to do, other than (gently) pump fresh air into the lungs of patients? 

Do you think that DIY/open source versions of them would be viable for emergency circumstances? 

In addition, I've read some talk about the use of sedation and lower pressure ventilators to prevent people from ""fighting"" it, which prevents the alveoli from being damaged. Does that change the way that large numbers of people are treated?","You're basically right - it pumps in a given volume (or pressure) of oxygen enriched air in periodic intervals. 

They are very complicated, especially because they have computers in them that calculate the amount of pressure needed, the timing of the breaths, and all sorts of other parameters. Perhaps basic vents can be open-sourced, and honestly even basic vents would help in these emergency circumstances.

You are right about preventing alveolar damage - for the type of lung pathology Covid-19 patients suffer (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) it is critical not to use too high pressures otherwise the alveoli can be damaged. The vent settings therefore need to be carefully titrated to the patient, and his/her condition. This can require a lot of micromanagement of the vent. If the ICU is full of ARDS patients, this can make overall vent management of the unit a huge burden. Respiratory therapists are key in this regard.",drdrintensivistmdphd,2020-03-18 14:30:39+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fkpjjh/hello_i_am_an_anesthesiologist_icu_physician_and/,"Hello, I am an anesthesiologist, ICU physician, and have a PhD in Pharmacology.

First off thank you for answering our questions.
I’m not a medical professional so my words may be a bit elementary.

Wouldn’t the virus go into hibernation(?) if we self quarantine/isolate? 
Basically I am  wondering if someone who is a carrier and never gets sick self quarantines for however long is recommended, then they come out and carry on as usual. Couldn’t they still pass it on to someone who is susceptible? 

How long does the virus live in a host(?)?

Won’t the virus still be viable(?) in those who carry but don’t get sick?","Please read through this thread, all those questions have been answered.",drdrintensivistmdphd,2020-03-18 20:46:20+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fkpjjh/hello_i_am_an_anesthesiologist_icu_physician_and/,"Hello, I am an anesthesiologist, ICU physician, and have a PhD in Pharmacology.

Medicine, pulm, surgeons, they all have to ask nurses to administer meds, adjust pumps, start IVs, have to ask RTs to adjust vents etc., have to ask anesthesiologists to intubate.

The vaccine manufacturing scale-up is just as important as these clinical trials in order to meet the demand for the vaccine. To receive the vaccine after clinical trials, people would go to health clinics, pharmacies, or family physicians.

How does this virus compare to other coronaviruses out there?,"This link below has a really good answer, but we'll try to summarize

[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130)

SARS-2 CoV seems to be able to spread while asymptomatic, which is not seen in SARS-1 or MERS. This is definitely contributing to its ability to spread more than SARS-1 and MERS. A total of 8096 SARS cases and 774 deaths across 29 countries were reported for an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 9.6%. MERS is still not contained and is thus far responsible for 2494 confirmed cases and 858 deaths across 27 countries for a CFR of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases, but the deaths per infection are lower.

We, like others, have observed that the inter-example variance of this new coronavirus is much lower than previously observed species.

However, there could be some sample bias here. The amount and speed of the data being produced here is unprecedented and drawing conclusions is somewhat speculative, still.

Much like other recently emerging coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, it appears that the new SARS-COV-2 had its origins in a bat reservoir with passage through some intermediate species that we have not yet observed. This is based on its sequence similarity to the bat coronavirus RaTG13. MRIGlobal has been using novel machine learning techniques to build models of many of the viruses that have been identified as high concern to human health, including coronaviruses. However, the diversity in bat coronaviruses observed so far is very high, and our sampling of this community is sparse. We think that this emerging pathogen highlights the need to increase data collection, data quality standards, and leveraging of new computational tools.",MRIGlobal,2020-03-04 12:40:17+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fdemjd/we_are_researchers_at_mriglobal_developing/,We are researchers at MRIGlobal developing testing methods ＆ biosafety procedures for COVID-19 ＆ will test the efficacy of the vaccine.

"Excuse my ignorance here. Couple of serious questions. If you can answer that's cool, if not, that's also fine. 

If I get it once. Am I potentially less susceptible to getting it again? If I do get it again, will it be more severe than the first? 

Can you Eli5 why there are currently so many positive tests returning negatives the first time (in some cases first 2 - 3 times) is it hard  to test for? 

What is your understanding / opinion on there being potentially 2 strands? Is this good or bad? I read it's potentially mutated into a less aggressive variant? But that also has down sides?

Why are children much less impacted?

Why does Africa seem to have low impacted? Purely low travel, or genetics / weather. 

Any good podcast episodes you may have listed to recently about corona? 

I'll leave it at thar for now.","Our assessment of the CDC assay is that it is robust and rigorous. Sample storage and transport could be the culprit of positive tests following negative tests. This is common with respiratory pathogens and is part of the disease process. 

There is only very preliminary data on the potential of a second strain. There are thousands of coronaviruses and this data could be the result of laboratory contamination, etc. It is simply still too early to tell. Viruses tend to become less infectious over time and more transmittable.

Most people that end up in the hospital with severe complications are older and typically have co-morbidities. Until there is more epidemiological testing done, we won't know the infection rate in children. Most people will have a mild infection, much like a cold, and may never be tested for COVID-19. 

In Africa, the low impact could be explained by the lack of testing available in the area for now.

Is it true that this is the type of virus that will mutate slightly and return every cold season?  Will it become part of the regular flu vaccine?,"For a virus to return every season, like you describe, it needs to be able to infect enough people that, even when it’s not “in season”, there is a minimum amount of person-to-person transmission continuing at all times. Maintaining that transmission requires the virus to mutate over time, or else eventually it runs out of susceptible people infect. 

One of the goals of the massive global effort to contain SARS-coronavirus-19 that we’re seeing right now is to prevent this virus from becoming permanently established in humans. Current efforts to develop a vaccine against this virus appear to be focusing on targeting SARS-coronavirus-19 specifically, or this virus as well as SARS-coronavirus-1 and MERS. 

It’s a little early yet to see whether a vaccine for SARS-coronavirus-19 would be formulated as part of a multi-component vaccine, like influenza, or if it would be produced as a single-component vaccine.",MRIGlobal,2020-03-04 14:51:44+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fdemjd/we_are_researchers_at_mriglobal_developing/,We are researchers at MRIGlobal developing testing methods ＆ biosafety procedures for COVID-19 ＆ will test the efficacy of the vaccine.

"Thanks for sharing your expertise!   
What do businesses, large venues, etc need to do to prepare for this? What extra steps should be done to ensure safety for staff and visitors?","Extra steps to help ensure the safety of staff and visitors, whether you’re a small business or a large venue, include ensuring that you have extra supplies of hand soap, hand sanitizer, and tissues readily available and easily accessible, as well as evaluating whether your current housekeeping/facility hygiene practices should be enhanced for the near future (such as by disinfecting doorknobs daily). Large venues, or businesses with a large number of daily visitors, may want to consider whether they can establish a designated location where staff, visitors, or or event attendees who fall ill on site can be temporarily isolated until they can be transferred to an appropriate health care facility.

Businesses of all sizes should assess what plans they have in place for minimizing potential infection of employees in the workplace and for ensuring continuity of operations in the event that large numbers of staff are absent due to illness or to caregiving responsibilities. Are employees able to/allowed to work from home? Is your current sick leave policy adequate? Are your staff discouraged from going in to work when sick? What about your part time/contract staff/vendors? Are there essential operations that can be shifted to an alternate site? Is there a plan for ensuring that critical job functions and positions are covered if the primary staff performing those roles are absent?

Large venues in particular should stay abreast of their local public health authorities’ recommendations on mass gatherings, and have a strategy mapped out in advance for determining when events should be postponed or cancelled, and what actions need to be taken if an event is postponed or cancelled.

"Question about the name COVID-19. It was chosen to not evoke a geographic, animal or otherwise biased thought. However, the virus' name is SARS 2 (basically). Why is COVID-19 not named something like SARS-2 or SARS-19?","The naming follows best practices for naming of new human infectious diseases.

It’s common to have different names for viruses and diseases; HIV and AIDS is one example. Very often, members of the general public may not even know the names of viruses that cause common diseases – everyone has heard of measles, for example, but fewer people could name the virus that causes it (rubeola).

Diseases are named to enable public health professionals to discuss the prevention, spread, transmissibility, severity and treatment of disease.

If you can get a ""fit test' for an N95 mask, that would be great. Also important are proper don and doff of the mask.  Some people put themselves at risk when they remove a mask, for example, by sticking ungloved fingers at the bridge of their nose and pushing those fingers downwards as they remove their mask, and that places potentially contaminated fingers close to the nose. This creates a situation where one could deposit fomites or other virus-contaminated particles close to the nose, and these might be inhaled.  Stay away from flimsy face masks, especially those that look like a gauze or net, as they will not be protective.  The better face masks, even if they are not N95 masks, will offer some protection from contaminated droplets.

My question is how exactly does the virus lead to deadly symptoms of pneumonia etc.?,"Exactly? We need more information. But basically, if the virus is truly similar to SARS CoV, what we know is this: The virus targets epithelial cells of the respiratory tract when it first causes an infection (other organ systems are affected subsequently).  The danger is when our alveoli are infected. Alveoli are the site in our lower lungs where oxygen uptake occurs. If the alveoli are killed, that of course creates breathing difficulties. As the cells die, fluid from the bloodstream leaks into the lower lung area, and pneumonia results.

"Based on sequence alone, how well can you model or predict (virus) virulence, transmission from host to another and stability outside host ?","Profound question that would take days to answer! Bottom line is sequence information gives clues but does NOT answer the question about virulence. Clue because if a new virus is similar to a known virulent virus, the first assumption is both new and old virus may be equally virulent. But that has to be tested/proven through medical observation, and laboratory tests. For transmission from host to another host, epidemiology studies are required, and aerobiology studies also. The latter are technically difficult to do (look up review articles from my laboratory group about that), and some animal modeling must also be done. If the virus originated from an animal, surveillence tests must be performed, and the virus isolated from the animal.  determining stability outside the host requires laboratory tests. In my laboratory, we take pure preparations of a virus, deposit those on test surfaces, and determine how long the virus stays infectious under controlled humidity, light, and temperature conditions over an observation period that may be one month long.",ufexplore,2020-01-30 10:33:06+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ew6jfh/i_am_a_research_professor_who_detects_isolates/,"I am a research professor who detects, isolates and performs genetic analysis of respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses and animal and human influenza viruses, as well as arboviruses.

That is an evolutionary advantage to the virus in the sense that by mutating constantly, antibodies to previous versions of the virus are not able to prevent spread of the virus (ie, the virus would likely go extinct if enough hosts had antibodies the virus). There are many ways viruses are transmitted. All things kept equal, the viruses that are easiest to transmit human to human are those that have mutated ('Adapted') to attach to and enter human cells.  That also affects 'contagion'.

It would be kinda silly if this was an accidental release or purposely done, as this would be a state targeting its own people.  But one can never fully know state (government) secrets.

For example, this virus and SARS CoV are highly related to various bat viruses, and at the live food market in Wuhan, bats and animals that might consume them (civet cat? badger?) if a sick bat was grounded are sold for food.  The animals are caged and crowded and maintained in unhygenic conditions, creating conditions wehre urine, fecal material, and so on containing this and other viruses get deposited onto surfaces or are aerosolized.

Once you have the code, bioinformatics specialists use sophisticated computer programs to determine how closely related the virus is to other known viruses.

"1. Even if there was an actual 100% worldwide lockdown for months, how would that stop any virus?  It is still in the world, it is still on various surfaces, it was created, either by man or nature, and is not going to just disappear from the Earth.  Wouldn’t someone wind up getting it once we are back doing regular daily routines and then it would spread again?

Virus degrades on surfaces after a relatively short period of time, although it is prudent to disinfect surfaces regularly.

"Does the current patent system trouble you that drug companies will spend less on R&D due to a loss of protection in medical methods such as administration and dosing? Namely, the decisions in Bilski, Mayo, and Alice.

"1. Early on I heard that PCR test kits have to repeated, and only after three negative results somebody is considered (very likely) as not having an active infection.

What would you recommend to do in terms of preparation and prevention of Coronoavirus?,"Good question.  Here are the CDC guidelines:

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html

Basically on an individual level, it is everything that you have been hearing and all the same things you do to prevent getting influenza: 

- Wash hands with soap for at least 20 seconds; 
- Avoid touching your face after you have been touching surfaces used by others;
- Cough into your elbow, not hands or on other people (which is rude and bad infection control!)
- If you can, keep a distance of 6 feet from those who are visibly sick
- Stay home if you feel sick

Don't buy masks. You don't need them unless you are sick, and our health workers who work very closely with sick people really do need them.

There may come a time when other nations or communities need to do the same.  That said, we are not there yet in London or NYC.

How does COVID-19 compare to the Spanish flu from 1918?,"*It looks like the original reply here was removed because of a shortened link. Here it is again:* 

Great question and hello to all participants. I am glad to get to have this discussion with you.

The short answer is that we don’t know yet. It is still a relatively new virus and with each day we’re learning more.

We are pretty certain that COVID-19 will become a pandemic (with worldwide spread), but we don’t know yet for sure if it will a mild, moderate, or severe one.

The issue is knowing more about (1) the transmissibility of the virus and (2) its severity. We have pretty good idea that COVID-19 spreads pretty easily, with each infecting person one to 3 other people. That is more transmissible that SARS in 2002-2003 or Ebola, but not nearly as transmissible as measles.

The big known question is how many people does the virus kill or make seriously ill. In China, the fatality rate per case was about 3 percent and one out of 7 got severely ill. That is pretty severe – the 1918 flu had a case fatality rate of about 2 and the average flu has case fatality of about 0.1 percent

That said, outside of the overwhelmed health system of Hubei province, the case fatality rate from COVID-19 has been a lot lower. As I wrote yesterday in Foreign Affairs, China has some of the poorest lung health in the world. Singapore has had 110 cases and no deaths.

Here is the FA link for those interested: [https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-03-02/what-world-can-learn-chinas-experience-coronavirus](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-03-02/what-world-can-learn-chinas-experience-coronavirus)",the_mit_press,2020-03-03 12:14:28+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fcwnw5/im_thomas_bollyky_the_director_of_the_global/,"I’m Thomas Bollyky, the director of the Global Health program at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of “Plagues and the Paradox of Progress.” I’m here to answer your questions about the coronavirus and infectious diseases.

"Considering what China had to do to reduce the R0 number, do you believe that the lack of initiatives in the United States to quarantine cities, apartment buildings, drones monitoring people, etc will eventually result in a worse outcome in the United States than what China has experienced?","Another great question.  Thanks for submitting it.  Governments are going to have to consider carefully which parts of China’s experience will be generalizable to their countries.

Understanding the factors that affect a person’s immune response to COVID-19 will likely matter as much as or more than understanding the virus itself. Poor lung health abounds in China more than in other nations. One out of two adult men in China smoke. The effects of smoking on COVID-19 have not yet been determined, but previous studies have shown that smoking increases the severity of influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, another coronavirus. China is heavily urbanized and has terrible rates of air pollution, which may contribute to spread.

On the positive side, China is constructing new hospitals, taking whole hospitals out of general service and devoting them to COVID-19 response, and has mobilized thousands nurses and doctors, respirators and other pneumonia-support equipment. That will be tough for other nations to match, including the US where hospitals operate at or close to capacity.

On the issue of quarantine and surveillance, my feeling is that no other nation can or should seek to replicate China’s action. Speed, transparency, and accurate, science-based risk communication are what really matter. Research shows that China’s most effective measures against this virus have also been those that can be undertaken without trampling on human rights: suspending public transport, closing entertainment venues, and limiting public gatherings. Health-care facilities and departments in the United States and other nations should be preparing now—with training, equipment, and detailed operational plans—for the surge in COVID-19 patients, especially among the elderly, that China’s example shows will soon come.

Here is the study assessing China's effectiveness on COVID-19:

What's the (realistic) best case scenario? And what's the worst case scenario?,"Based on what we know today, the best case scenario based is that this is roughly equivalent to a moderate to bad seasonal flu. 

The worse case scenario, again, based on what we know know, is this is closer to the 1957 and 1968 flu pandemic.  I don't think that many people *yet* think this is likely to be as bad as 1918.

What's the most prominent misconception that you'd like to address right now?,"Thanks. I still get questions about whether COVID-19 is a bio-weapon released by China. One source of rumours was a paper posted by scientists in India claiming that short insertions in the viral genome had an “uncanny similarity” to HIV. And, to be fair, there have been US politicians who promoted this theory as well.  

The credible papers that I have seen on the genetic analysis of the virus suggest that the mutations are completely consistent with natural evolution.

Do you think it will get so bad that Japan will cancel the Olympics?,"Good question. Japan and the International Olympic Committee have repeatedly said that the games will be held, on schedule, during the summer 2020. However, Japan's Olympic minister said today that, “The IOC has the right to cancel the games only if they are not held during 2020. This can be interpreted to mean the games can be postponed as long as they are held during the calendar year.”

Also, how to prevent going to the doctors without a real cause, so you don't clog up the system and/or get put into quarantine ""until the lab results are back"" over a simple cold.","Good question. Symptoms can appear within two to fourteen days after exposure. According to CDC, most common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. CDC advises that you call your healthcare professional as soon as you develop symptoms and either have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19 or have traveled from or through an area with widespread or ongoing community spread of the disease. If you are a resident in a community where person-to-person spread of COVID-19 has been detected and you develop symptoms, CDC advises that you call your healthcare provider and describe your symptoms.

For those with mild cases of COVID-19, CDC says patients can be treated at home with a healthcare provider's approval if the patient is stable enough to receive care at home, is capable of adhering to home-care precautions (e.g. respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, hand hygiene, etc.), and meets other requirements. For instance, Georgia's Public Health Department said yesterday that the two cases confirmed yesterday in the state are currently in home isolation, as their symptoms are minimal.

"Hi sir,

What is done to carry out fast tracking of clinical trials of potential vaccines? Also, when do you think it will be ready?","Great question. The US National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (part of the NIH) has been working the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to fast track several vaccine candidates. Part of the supplemental budget request to Congress is for  additional resources to support the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. 

That all said, I would not expect a vaccine this season and, probably, not before next year sometime. Most vaccine candidates take years to  get through clinical trials and most, if not all, of  these COVID-19 vaccine candidates have not even entered phase I clinical trials.  

In the 2013-2015 West Africa Ebola outbreak, there was a rush of pharma companies working to develop vaccines for that virus, taking advantage of the fact that there were already several candidates for ebola that had already been through phase II clinical trials (testing safety and preliminary effectives).  Even that vaccine did not get all the way through the develpment process until the DRC outbreak of Ebola in 2018.

For the foreseeable future, it will be our healthcare systems and shoe leather public health measures that get us through COVID-19, not waiting for a miracle medical intervention like a vaccine.

hope that helps!

"Do you forsee any policies restricting movement, work, transit etc being implemented in the USA as they were in china? If so, what kinds of economic or societal impacts would we see if it did escalate to that point? Thanks in advance.","It's a fair question, but I think it is much more likely that such actions will occur at the state and local levels than at the USA level. This is for both public health reasons -- the need and usefulness of those policies are going to vary by community -- and legal reasons -- the legal authority to exercise that authority rests for the most part with states.

There is no question however that such measures have a dramatic effect on economies and societies. In most epidemics, it is not the direct effects of epidemics that do the most damage to health and economies. It is the indirect effects that add up --  all the economic activities like shopping and traveling that people forego, the physician visits and ordinary vaccinations people avoid in their effort not to get sick.  

hope that helps.

"Have societal and technological changes over the past century made world more or less vulnerable to epi/pandemics?


I.e. it seems as though healthcare and treatments have gotten much more advanced and the internet allows for more social distancing to combat disease. Conversely, air travel and increased urbanization have made it presumably easier for disease to spread.","Great question! The short answer is yes and this is a major theme of my book.  

Emerging and treatment-resistant pathogensveasily cross national boundaries, given increases in global trade, faster travel, and rising global temperatures (resulting in warmer, more virus-friendly climates).  Another factor has been that we have gotten healthier (less infectious diseases) without that the same improvements in healthcare systems that once had to accompany reductions of infectious and child deaths before the development of most vaccines and increased availability of availability of antibiotics after WWII.

Even in countries with the most rudimentary health systems, better medicines and more international aid in developing and disseminating
medical advances has yielded longer lives, fewer dead children and grief-stricken families, and less human suffering more generally. Yet it has also made many nations more vulnerable to contagious viruses for which there are no available drugs to treat and no vaccines to prevent
infections, and against which people have no preexisting immunity.

COVID-19 is an example of such a disease.

thanks for the question and sorry for the worrisome answer,

"Thank you for taking the time to do this; I'm sure you must be quite busy these days.

Do you think that indirect casualties (due to overwhelmed hospitals, shortage of medicines and possibly looting/lawlessness) will become an important component of the final death toll?","Thanks for this question. 

Yes, I think hospitals overwhelmed with actual and suspected COVID-19 cases will have a direct and indirect effect on casualties. This novel coronavirus has so overwhelmed the health-care system in Hubei Province, which includes Wuhan and is the epicenter of the outbreak, that it is killing people there at a rate four to six times greater than that in the rest of China. 

See this report from the China CDC: 
https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf

In the West Africa Ebola outbreak, a significant part of the health toll were due to falling vaccination rates. It is no accident that the DRC has had a measles outbreak amid the stuggle to contain the Ebola virus outbreak there.

"First, thank you so much for doing this - it's a great community service.

Similar to other questions regarding non-essential medical appointments/ services I have a question regarding prescriptions.

I'm finishing a second degree at Western (so I've been here....awhile....) and as such my GP for years has been a specific physician at the Western University Clinic. Today I received a call from the clinic instructing me to come in immediately to pick up serum vials that I keep there for injections - in case the clinic shuts down. Now I'm in the midst of figuring out where to continue my injections, but my real worry is that if they shut down I won't have access to my GP to refill my ADHD stimulant prescription. 

I'm not sure if a walk-in clinic would write a stimulant prescription without having seen me before, and as of now (since I've just been titrating dosages) I don't have any refills on my script. I have an appointment with my GP Thursday but I am admittedly a little worried about the situation. I kind of need a daily dose to manage (especially now with the semester ending AND being unstructured online lectures) and if there is a shut down before Thursday I’m not sure what my options are.

"Hey Abdul! 

My mother is an nurse currently working in Chelsea and Ann Arbor. Due to her previous ICU experience she was deemed as an essential health care worker, and is now fighting to save lives on the front lines of this pandemic.

I couldn't be more proud of my mom, but I am must admit that I am scared and very concerned of her health and safety of all of our brave healthcare workers during this time.

The stories I have been hearing are quite concerning. Reports of personell being told they may need to make impromptu mask during a shortage, extremely long hours of non stop rushing, and most recently 2 MAs my mother had been directly working with tested positive. Since then my mother has fallen ill, she has a fever between 100 and 100.3 degrees. She had previous respiratory issues and she is still being asked to come in to work in Ann Arbor.They say they refuse to test her until she is above 100.5 degrees and showing active signs of coughing or SOB.

 I'm very concerned if all of what I have been hearing is indeed the normal, or if we should expect it to get worse, or if I should be concerned for my mom and ask her not to work. Again, I am very proud of her and dont want to selfishly ask her to stop when she is saving lives, but I am concerned and living in Washington state now where I cant easily be there if needed.

"Hi Abdul,

I love your podcast and so happy to have your voice in my ear.

Currently, are we having any impact on the virus? Are we flattening the curve?

What will this world look like after we beat this thing with a vaccine?

Have you seen skeptics in the anti-vaxxer community even as this thing is ravaging through?

Thanks for your time and effort!","Thank you for listening. Unfortunately, right now it's accelerating. But we have to keep committing to this to get there.

"Hi Dr. El-Sayed, thank you for doing this AMA.

I am a current MPH Epidemiology student who is set to graduate in a few weeks, so I am eager to do all I can to help!

I have a few questions about the reproductive number of COVID-19 and if you have any more up-to-date information on it? I see estimates from over 10 days ago stating ~1.5-3.5, but no real concrete number. Similar to this, what is the average latent period you have seen (if any), and how long does it seem to remain transmissible in cases? (I understand this is probably a way too early question).

My father is the head of a large section of Vermont's response (and is severely immunocompromised himself but is still seeing patients) and calls often to vent about lack of testing. The thing that strikes us a lot is the lack of reporting number of tests provided so that we can get some sort of denominator to go off of when looking at incidence and mortality. Have you heard any talk about publishing the number of tests used?","These are all great questions. Clear your MPH really empowered you. Glad you're going out to to do this work.

You're right, it's just too early right now to really have characterized this. The R0 can be calculated from the disease curve, latency can be poorly inferred, though. So we really need more direct analysis of actually patients to understand this.

And you're right. W/o good denominator data, it's hard to make ANY sense of these numbers, and how they change!

And grateful for heroes like your father.",IAmAbdul,2020-03-26 16:29:43+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fph4aj/im_dr_abdul_elsayed_physician_epidemiologist/,"I’m Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, physician, epidemiologist, former health commissioner, and progressive activist, and author of Healing Politics: A Doctor’s Journey into the Heart of our Political Epidemic--AMA!",https://reddit.com/r/politics,

Okay, having half jokingly gotten that out of my system I can move on to the real issue:

One of the major frustrating failings being highlighted in our response to this pandemic has been the sheer number of resources being ignored. We have countless unlicensed MDs who could be doing...Something.

Myself included, I'm an IMG with ER experience and, thanks to COVID, nothing but time on my hands and an ever growing sense of irritation that I'm not scrubbing in to do something, anything to help.

There's a theoretical issue and a practical one. In theory if we all just stopped everything for 14 days and froze in spot, we could end this in 14 days. But that's not going to happen. Practically, we have to watch the numbers. When they start to go down, we'll have a sense of when the end is in sight. That said, it's plausible that we could relax these measures--and it would shoot right back up.
